Judge’s gavel [Courtesy]  A court in Lodwar has granted the Public Health Department permission to destroy five tonnes of dry fish believed to be contaminated.  Turkana Central Public Health Officer Lumbasi Rapando said the fish was seized at a store in Kalokol awaiting exportation to the Democratic Republic of Congo.  According to a report by the government chemist presented in court, the fish was contaminated with an insecticide called Sevin Dudu dust.  Rapando had warned the chemical was harmful. “Take notice that the use of Dudu Dust as a pesticide for control of insects infestation in dried fish is not acceptable as it is harmful to human health, and therefore be stopped immediately,” read a notice on January 11, 2019.  Nanok backtracks on talks with KDF, decries insecurity  Government to destroy 1, 200 bags of poisonous maize at Isebania border  Grief as three boys drown in abandoned pit  Dozens in hospital after consuming camel meat  Faida ya Daraja: Wakazi wa Lodwar wafurahia ujenzi wa daraja, walikuwa wakipitia hali ngumu  Jeshi la nzige lavamia Lodwar na kusababisha hofu kwa Wenyeji  Wazazi walalamikia kiasi cha karo wanaotakiwa nayo kabla kujiunga shule mjini Lodwar By Jacob Ng’etich | 2 days ago By Mireri Junior | 12 days ago By Betty Njeru | 14 days ago By Grace Ng'ang'a | 16 days ago
