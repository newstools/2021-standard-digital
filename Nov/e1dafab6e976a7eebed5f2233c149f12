Former Treasury CS Henry Rotich (pictured) has been charged afresh with conspiracy to defraud Sh63 billion in the Arror and Kimwarer dams case.  Rotich and his eight co-accused faced the charges after anti-corruption chief magistrate Lawrence Mugambi allowed the prosecution to drop charges against nine other accused persons and to amend the charge sheet.  “The prosecution has the power to amend the charge sheet and drop charges against any of the accused persons without necessarily informing the court of their reasons. What the court is interested in is the end result of their prosecution,” ruled Mugambi.  The Director of Public Prosecution agreed to drop charges against the nine after they agreed to be prosecution witnesses.  Court gives nod for ex-CS Rotich to be charged afresh  Ex-Treasury CS Rotich opposes plan to consolidate cases  DPP seeks to drop charges against six in Arror, Kimwarer dams case  Italian firm in dams scandal auctioned Those charged afresh alongside Rotich were former Chief Economist Kennedy Nyakundi, former Kerio Valley Development Authority boss David Kimosop and former National Environment Management Authority Managing Director Geoffrey Wahungu.
