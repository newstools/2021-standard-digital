The Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) registered significant growth in cargo volumes in October compared to September, according to the latest numbers by Kenya Railways Corporation.  In October, 221 freight trains left the port of Mombasa to the Nairobi Inland Container Depot (ICD), delivering 19,294 twenty-foot equivalent (TEUs) of containerised cargo and 190,408 tonnes of bulk cargo of various commodities that included wheat, fertiliser and clinker.  From the Nairobi ICD, 1,274 TEUs of exports and 15,582 TEUs of returned empty containers were delivered back to the port, said the rail firm in a statement.   This was a notable improvement from September when Afristar, the SGR operator, deployed 216 trains that delivered 20,824 TEUs and 117,121 tonnes of conventional cargo.    Two suspects arrested for vandalizing SGR line  Cuban woman says football star Maradona raped her as teenager, 'stole my childhood'  Mai Mahiu population to rise as infrastructural development pick  Backstabbing, skullduggery alleged in DCI Mombasa Port probe  Hits and Misses of the SGR project as it marked 4 years since the launch of its operations  Reli ya SGR Tanzania: Reli ya umeme kuanza kutumika Agosti, ni reli ya umbali wa kilomita 205  Kenya to take over SGR from Chinese operator | Press Review By Macharia Kamau and Wainaina Wambu | 2 hours ago By Peter Theuri | 1 day ago By Patrick Alushula | 1 day ago By Patrick Alushula | 1 day ago
