A worker at Hekima school fumigates the school bus. [Denish Ochieng, Standard]  Amani National Congress leader and presidential aspirant Musalia Mudavadi has complained that some politicians are using school buses to ferry their supporters. That is wrong and worthy of strong condemnation.  There are several reasons why school buses should never be used for political campaigns. The main one of course is the possibility of their being destroyed by political hooligans  The use of school buses for political purposes was banned by Dr Fred Matiang'i in 2017 while he was the Education CS. Current Education CS George Magoha also banned the hiring out of the buses due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  It is shameful that politicians still want to use these vehicles and head teachers have the audacity to hire out the buses. They must be discouraged.  Stop hiring out buses to politicians, schools told   Musalia Mudavadi: I will go all the way to the ballot  Meru ANC branch elects new chair  Musalia Mudavadi unveils new party secretary general, promises to work with youth   Ruto and his allies push for amendments in the BBI Report, Mudavadi calls for dialogue and truce  How Godfrey Osotsi earned a temporary reprieve against losing seat  Where the 'rains started beating' ANC nominated Senator Godfrey Atieno Osotsi By Editorial | 13 hours ago By Editorial | 1 day ago By Editorial | 2 days ago By Editorial | 3 days ago
