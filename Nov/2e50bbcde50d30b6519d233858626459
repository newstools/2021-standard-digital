A mother of five reportedly battered her inebriated husband to death with a stone in Marigat, Baringo County, on Saturday.  According to the statement she made to the police after surrendering, Nancy Jebet, 33, said she attacked her husband because she could not endure his harassment anymore.  Jebet and Joseph Kipteto, 43, had been married 15 years and had five children.   Jebet is a farmer, while Kipteto was still seeking employment. She said he spent a lot of his time drinking alcohol.  No, Luos are not violent, and don’t stereotype people  Politicians must avoid careless, inciteful talk  How our silence eggs on the oppressors in society  Raila and Ruto must rein in their troops to avert chaos She said their living situation was so bad that sometimes they had to send away their children to their grandmother.  On Saturday evening, Kipteto came home drunk and fell on the bed.  Marigat subcounty police commander David Too said it was then that Jebet came with a stone and hit him on the head.  “It is unfortunate that the couple was fighting at their homestead. The place is rocky and the woman used a stone to hit her husband,” Too said.  Police are yet to establish the exact cause of the fight.   It was Kipteto's brother, Augustine Koech, who reported the matter to the police after his brother succumbed to the injuries.  Koech said Jebet and Kipteto have had a problematic marriage for a long time, which at one point led to Jebet going back to her parents.
