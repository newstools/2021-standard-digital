Tenges MCA Silas Tochim outside Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) offices in Nakuru on February 22, 2021. [Kipsang Joseph, Standard]  A Baringo MCA is being held at the Central Police Station, Nairobi, following a complaint from a businesswoman over an alleged deal gone sour.  Silas Tochim, the Tenges Ward Rep, was arrested on Friday evening and recorded a statement.  Central Sub-County Police Commander Adamson Bungei confirmed the MCA was in police custody.  “He was brought here after a complaint was made from someone,” he said.  Inside Naivasha sharpened spoon inmate murder  Deals of the year  You want a better deal?

The businesswoman from Baringo claims Tochim took her money, which isn’t the case but pure politics,” he claimed.  Also at the station were some of Tochim's supporters, led by Lembus Kwen MCA Lawi Kipchumba, who claimed the arrest was questionable.  “We don’t know why he has been arrested. We suspect his detention is in connection with his political ambitions after he declared he will contest for a county seat,” said Kipchumba.  Tochim was released at around 3.30pm yesterday after being grilled for the better part of the day by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations officers.  When contacted on phone soon after being set free, the MCA was noncommittal about the matter only saying: “Treat what you have been told as propaganda. As far as I am concerned I am a free man, currently on the ground in the village.”   By Robert Kiplagat  | 3 hours ago By Lucas Ngasike | 1 day ago By Julius Chepkwony | 1 day ago By Julius Chepkwony | 1 day ago
