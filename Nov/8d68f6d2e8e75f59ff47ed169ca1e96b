The government has dispatched another contingency of security officers to Samburu and Marsabit counties to quell the ongoing violence that has seen more than 14 residents killed.  Interior Cabinet Secretary Dr Fred Matiang’i said the situation in the two counties was being fueled by ethnic and clan-based rivalry.  He said the state is taking a multi-dimensional approach to maintain security, drawing focus on using dialogue and diplomacy to deal with the violence which he noted has been historical in the areas.  The CS, who was speaking at Nyakemincha High School today where he helped raise funds for the institution, said the government will not dwell on using force to quell violence.  "We cannot always use guns to achieve peace in areas where there is violence. We want to embark on talking to leaders and engaging them with their people to broker peace," Matiang’i said.  Marsabit clash victims buried as politicians warned  Uproar in Likuyani as police posts closed  14 people killed, two injured in Samburu cattle raids  Keveye Girls on the rampage, say school treating their security lightly According to Matiang'i, dialogue with leaders and residents will help in weeding out historical cases of violence.    Insecurity in Murang'a: Government moves in to stem vices, conflicts reported during lockdown  Shule nne kwenye mpaka wa kaunti za Baringo na Turkana zafungwa kutokana na utovu wa usalama  Interior CS Matiang'i meets leaders from the Northern counties over rising insecurity in the area By Stephen Rutto | 6 hours ago By Michael Saitoti | 21 hours ago By Kennedy Gachuhi | 21 hours ago By Titus Too | 22 hours ago
