Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong (pictured) has formed the County Health Services Fund Board to pave way for the utilisation of money collected by health facilities in the area.  The utilisation of the Facility Improvement Fund (FIF) has been enabled by the recently passed County Health Services Fund (Amendment) Act, 2021 and the County Community Health Services Act, 2021.  “The Acts have been long in coming and will enable a fraction of the money collected in hospitals to be utilised by the facilities to buy medical essential products like gloves, syringes, masks and related stuff rather than waiting for the national government disbursements, which are not consistent,” said Ojaamong.  “The laws also create a fund to pay community health volunteers (CHV) some stipends to boost their morale in delivering services to the doorsteps of the people, especially the elderly and children.”  Haji asks court to lock out Orengo from Ojaamong's graft case  Governors skip senate committee 'grilling' sessions  Boost as county, authority launch Sh54m water project in Bunyala  Ojaamong rejects budget over tax target, bursary cuts County Health Executive Moses Mulomi said the County Assembly had already factored Sh41 million in the supplementary budget for paying the volunteers stipends.  “We will add Sh11 million to the kitty so that the CHVs get stipends throughout the year. They do a commendable job and command honour at the grassroots where they help in exercises such as sensitising the people to take vaccines and administering the jabs,” said Mulomi during the commissioning of the board in Busia town.      Mipango ya rufaa ya BBI imetolewa, Wananchi waanza kusajiliwa NHIF Nyeri | MBIU YA KTN  "Any person who attempts to defraud the NHIF...will be dealt with accordingly," says President Uhuru  CS Mutahi Kagwe calls on more Kenyans to enroll for NHIF By Nathan Ochunge | 17 hours ago By Alexander Chagema | 1 day ago By Brian Kisanji | 1 day ago By Nathan Ochunge | 1 day ago
