An officer attached to the Presidential Unit is among three suspects arrested in Kutus in Gichugu for allegedly abducting a woman.    According to Gichugu Police Commander Anthony Mbogo, the General Service Unit (GSU) officer based at Ruiru and his two accomplices abducted 36-year-old Mercy Wahu and put her in a Probox.  The three suspects then forced Wahu to accompany them to a local bank to withdraw money.  However, the woman raised an alarm that attracted the public. Officers manning the bank pounced on the suspects and arrested them.   Lawyer fights AG’s bid to be enjoined in succession case  Speak loudly against forced disappearances of Al Shabaab suspects  Rights groups plan Friday protests over abductions  Rights groups accuse police of abducting Hassan Nandwa Mbogo said the officer was being sought for deserting duty since March.  “The officer was declared a deserter in the National Police Service.
