Press and Media Conference concept [Courtesy]  The UN has expressed concern on increased incidence of violence against journalists.  Despite the rise of extra-judicial killings among journalists, most perpetrators go unpunished. “Out of 10 journalists killed, one gets judicial closure, according to Unesco's global monitoring report,” said Prof Hubert Gijzen, Unesco Regional Director for Eastern Africa.  “Journalists are increasingly subjected to various forms of threats such as kidnappings, torture, arbitrary arrests, intimidation and attacks particularly in the digital space.”  Speaking at the Crowne Plaza during the commemoration of this year's International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists yesterday, the Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji noted the critical role of the media in investigations and law enforcement.  UN, Ethiopia rights panel to issue report on abuses in Tigray  Climate change talks offer Africa a big chance  Interview: China becomes strong supporter, contributor to global biodiversity agenda, says UN official  Uhuru in New York to chair UN Security Council session on peace   “ODDP and the Media Council of Kenya will foster free and fair environment for media,” he said  The Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambia commended the media for championing for democracy, rule of law, good governance, human rights, fight against corruption.   75th Anniversary of the United Nations  What Kenya winning a seat in the UN Security Council means |INSIDE POLITICS WITH BEN KITILI  Baraza la usambazaji maji latoa msaada By Augustine Oduor | 2 hours ago By Paul Ogemba | 11 hours ago By Beldeen Waliaula | 11 hours ago By Moses Nyamori | 11 hours ago
