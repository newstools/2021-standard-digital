The Amnesty International (AI) has asked the government to stop coercing Kenyans to take Covid-19 jabs.  The government recently threatened to bar those who would not produce Covid-19 jab certificates from accessing essential services.  Health CS Mutahi Kagwe and Tourism's Najib Balala on Sunday said Kenyans had up to December 21 to comply, failure to which they would not use public transport or access bars, hotels, restaurants and national parks.  “While there are legitimate public health reasons for as many people as possible to be vaccinated, these reasons should not deprive a person of their right to work, essential services, including education, health and security, and their freedom of movement...” said yesterday Irungu Houghton, the director, AI Kenya.   Amnesty International criticizes move to block unvaccinated Kenyans from government services  Vaccine passports okay, but Kagwe must do more  No Covid-19 certificate?
