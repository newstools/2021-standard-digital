Kiambu County leaders have urged the youth to come out in large numbers and register as voters.  The leaders raised concerns over the low turnout in most constituencies in the county that was targeting 300,000 new voters. So far, less than 50,000 people have enlisted as mass voter registration closes on Thursday.  Thika MP Wainaina wa Jungle has taken it upon himself to walk around the constituency to urge residents to register as voters.  “It does not matter how much decibels of noise you will make about leadership or any leader if you cannot register as a voter. You cannot make any electoral decision if you cannot vote,” Wainanina said.  Kiambu Town MP Jude Njomo said the voice of the people is in the vote and if they cannot register as voters then there is a big problem.    CS, former IEBC officials linked to election materials tender wars  Lawmakers now seek to allow use of nicknames on the ballot paper  IEBC commissioner wants voter registration exercise extended  How voter education enhances democracy and peaceful polls    ODM’s attempt to oust Chebukati from IEBC elicits mixed reactions | INSIDE POLITICS WITH BEN KITILI  IEBC launches 2020-2024 Strategic Plan ahead of the 2022 general elections  Uteuzi wa kidato cha kwanza, IEBC imezindua ruwaza na mikakati ya miaka mitano ijayo | MBIU YA KTN By Winfrey Owino | 1 day ago By Betty Njeru | 3 days ago By Fidelis Kabunyi | 3 days ago By Gerald Nyele | 4 days ago
