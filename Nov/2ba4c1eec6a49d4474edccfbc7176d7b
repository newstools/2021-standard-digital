A court has ordered a mother and her son to undergo DNA tests within seven days to ascertain their claim to a Sh200 million estate left behind by Nakuru businessman Washington Olweny.  Justice Teresia Matheka ordered Norah Atieno and John Odhiambo to appear before the Government Chemist in Nairobi to give samples.  The judge made the ruling yesterday after lawyer Wilfred Lusi, who is representing Phelisia Akoth, Olweny's widow, claimed that Atieno had refused to undergo the DNA test.  “The objector should be ordered to comply with the orders of the court and appear for DNA testing,” said Lusi.  Akoth, who is the late Olweny’s first wife, had claimed in court that Atieno and Odhiambo were not mother and son. According to Akoth, Atieno failed to give crucial details on Odhiambo, including the date and month of his birth, raising doubt over their relationship.  Governor Amason Kingi initiates talks to avert eviction of 35,000 squatters  Mbiyu Koinange's son barred from evicting six people from 4,000-acre land  Court stops NLC from allocating Yala swamp land  Time to take firm action against those behind 'witch' burning Akoth is seeking to block Atieno and another claimant, Ann Wanjiru, from getting a share of Olweny’s property.
