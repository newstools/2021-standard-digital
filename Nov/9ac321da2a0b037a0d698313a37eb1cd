TSP party leader Mwangi Kiunjuri during the Mount Kenya Unity Forum meeting in Naivasha on September 20, 2021.[Kipsang Joseph, Standard]  The Service Party (TSP) leader Mwangi Kiunjuri has warned Deputy President William Ruto against his call for six-piece voting pattern, saying the move is tantamount to weakening Mt Kenya leaders.  Speaking during the opening of TSP offices in Kathwana, Chuka Igamba Ng'ombe, in Tharaka Nithi County, Kiunjuri said Mt Kenya leaders should be firm in their resolve to protect their political vehicles, as this will earn them respect in the eyes of presidential hopefuls they wish to support.  "Kama vyama vya kisiasa lazima tuheshimiane (We have to respect one another). Don't say you were frustrated when you are also trying to frustrate others. It will be dangerous if we all get into one vehicle," he said.  The TSP leader said pre- and post-election coalitions will be entered into only if there will be existing political parties with backing.  Anne Waiguru, Wangui Ngirici clash before DP Ruto  Willy Mutunga: Ruto is a rich man who cuts an image of political hustler   Why 'selfnomics' sounds better than Railanomics, Rutonomics  DP’s rallying call to voters in his Rift backyard: Do not let me down While advocating for "mix-and-match voting pattern", Kiunjuri said party euphoria may yield poor leaders who only ride on party popularity, but no tangible development records to show.      Musalia: Don't use school buses for political activity  Tension still high in Tot, Elgeyo Marakwet county following recent bandit attack that left four dead  DP Ruto witnesses Waiguru-Ngirici supremacy war By Oscar Obonyo | 2 hours ago By Mireri Junior | 16 hours ago By Ndung’u Gachane and Jane Mugambi | 1 day ago By Edward Kosut | 1 day ago
