Many cases of people being abducted have been reported.  In May, Selahaddin Gulen, nephew of Turkey’s Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen was abducted in Nairobi on his way to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations offices.  Last month, Hassan Nandwa went missing hours after before turning up later after visiting the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit in Nairobi. The family of Ethiopian businessman Samson Gebreigzi claims he was abducted by police officers last Friday.  Most abductions have been blamed on the anti-terrorism police, yet that might not necessarily be true. Gangster-style abductions reflect negatively on a police service that has legal backing and structured mechanisms for making arrests.  The government has a duty to stop these abductions before criminals take advantage, abduct individuals for monetary gain knowing fully well the police will be blamed.  Rights groups plan Friday protests over abductions  Rights groups accuse police of abducting Hassan Nandwa  Nigeria rescues 187 people from kidnappers  New kidnappings: Muslim leaders demand answers from DCI boss Kinoti     Several children reported missing in Mukuru Kwa Reuben  Sakata ya watoto kutoweka katika mtaa wa Mukuru kwa Ruben  Weekend Prime: Kenya marks 5th Anniversary of Operation Linda Nchi 15/10/2016 By Editorial | 10 hours ago By Editorial | 1 day ago By Editorial | 1 day ago By Editorial | 2 days ago Why Ruto wants Chief Justice Koome out of 2022 polls team
