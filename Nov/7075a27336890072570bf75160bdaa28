[Courtesy]  A suspected livestock thief was lynched by a mob on Sunday night.   In the foiled attempt, a second suspect managed to escape during the 1am incident in Kibomet Estate.   The two men had allegedly entered into the home of Wycliffe Matangaro when one of them was cornered and beaten to death.   "I heard a commotion outside and when I came out, I saw a man escaping through the fence. I raised an alarm," Matangaro said.  Land disputes, poverty to blame for senseless lynching of the elderly  Widows' killings linked to appetite for land, not witchcraft, say groups  The untold story of Masten Wanjala  Four suspects linked to lynching of grannies detained for 10 days The man confessed that he and his accomplice were planning to steal a cow from the homestead.
