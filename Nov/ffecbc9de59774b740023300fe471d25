Gavel on desk [Courtesy]  A 45-year-old man who lured his lover’s daughter aged 13 with Sh100 before defiling her, has been imprisoned for 20 years.  Nakuru Principal Magistrate Yvonne Khatambi said the court needed to give a hefty punishment because such cases were becoming rampant.  Khatambi ruled that the prosecution proved beyond doubt that JM was guilty of the offence. JM committed the offence on June 14, 2020, at Mzee Wanyama area.  “The complainant remained consistent in her testimony during the examination in chief and during cross-examination. I believe her testimony,” said Khatambi.  Nakuru County to build Sh249m market for fish traders  Nakuru mourns popular mortician who inherited his father’s job  Nakuru’s lush green marijuana farms  Couple and two daughters die in accident on their way to a funeral She dismissed JM’s defence, terming it an afterthought.
