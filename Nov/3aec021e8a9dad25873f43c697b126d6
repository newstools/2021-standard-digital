Parents of six students of Kipture Secondary School, who were locked out of school for wearing religious headgear, have protested the decision.  The Catholic-sponsored institution imposed new regulations banning clothes that are not part of the school uniform.  Those locked out of school by the principal included three Form Four students, two in Form Two, and one in Form One.  The parents however said the decision infringed the children's right to education and freedom of worship.  The parents alongside the local leaders of African Church of the Holy Spirit protested at the county education director's offices in Kapsabet, but none of the senior officials addressed them.  They told The Standard they asked the school management to give a written directive banning the students from wearing turbans in school, but it has not provided.  "It is against our church's doctrines to remove the turban, and it cannot affect operations in the school. They have not shown us a written memo banning the religious outfits in the school," one parent lamented.  County Director of Education Zachary Mutuiri said the students had been recalled to resume classes as education stakeholders engage the school management over the matter.     By Antony Gitonga | 3 hours ago By Daniel Chege | 3 hours ago By Daniel Chege | 13 hours ago By James Munyeki | 1 day ago
