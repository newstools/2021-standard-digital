About 100 certified fish farmers have received 100,000 Nile tilapia fingerlings donated by the National Government, in partnership with Victory Farms.  Speaking in Siaya where fish farmers received the donation, executive for Agriculture, Elizabeth Oduor, said the donation would help meet demand in the local market.  "In Siaya, the production of fish has dropped. In the last financial year, we only realised 28,000 metric tonnes of fish," Oduor said, adding that the county produces three million fingerlings against a demand of 17 million.  About 350 farmers also received fishing equipment through the aquaculture business development support program.   How mother nature has messed busy Siaya beach  Tilapia skin now treating burns  Good laws set up to boost fishing, but policies are yet to take effect  How ‘ghost fishing’ feeds you plastics Titus Kilonzi, director of administration at the State Department of Fisheries said the donations would help improve production.      Fish theft threatens thriving cage fish farming business in Busia  Ajali Ya Boti Nakuru: Shughuli ya kuopoa mwili yta mvuvi aliyezama katika ziwa Nakuru inaendelea  Fishermen's agony: Malindi fishing industry takes a hit due to closure of China export market By James Omoro | 18 hours ago By Hudson Gumbihi | 1 day ago By James Omoro | 1 day ago By James Omoro | 3 days ago
