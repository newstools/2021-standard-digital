Nearly 4,000 people have died in road accidents since the beginning of this year.  Another 8,652 people have suffered serious injuries, according to statistics released by National Transport and Safety Authority during the World Day of Remembrance of Road Traffic Victims. These are very grim statistics.  Sadly, the situation will continue to get worse unless adequate measures are taken to reverse the trend. The truth of the matter is that reckless motorists are to blame for the bulk of the road crashes. They are fond of speeding, driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs and generally disregarding traffic rules.  Corrupt police officers don't help matters as they fail to take requisite legal action against such drivers, of course, after having their palms greased.  Unless we change the mindsets of these people, blood will continue to be spilled on our roads.  NTSA and Europe launch campaign to cut road accidents  Road deaths worrying  Careless lorry drivers and narrow bridges that claim innocent lives  Careless lorry drivers and narrow bridges that claim innocent lives     NTSA launches transport sector reforms in a bid to curb road carnage  Witnesses explain what they knows about the accident that killed former Nyeri Governor Wahome Gakuru  Ajali yawaua watu 14 Matuu, Machakos By Editorial | 4 hours ago By Editorial | 1 day ago By Editorial | 1 day ago By Editorial | 1 day ago
