The government has set aside Sh3 billion to put up requisite infrastructure to facilitate livestock export through the Lamu Port.  Livestock Principal Secretary Harry Kimtai said the land where a livestock facility will be constructed has been secured.  “Procurement has been done and the land fenced off for the project. Livestock prices will be based on an animal’s quality,” said Dr Kimtai.
