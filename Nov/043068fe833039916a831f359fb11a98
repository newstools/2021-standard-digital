Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has surpassed its tax collection target in the four months to October by Sh27.09 billion, on the back of recovering economy.  The taxman collected Sh631.03 billion between July and October, against a target of Sh603.94 billion - translating to a performance rate of 104.5 per cent.    The latest collections are 28.5 per cent above the Sh491.84 billion collected in a similar period last year, as coronavirus-induced economic hardships such as salary cuts and layoffs cut revenue collections.  Lies that bind at COP, with ever shifting goal posts  Women deserve access to quality reproductive healthcare services  Covid-19: 46 recover as 76 test positive  Kenya receives Sh400 million for syringe manufacturing Major tax heads including customs and border control, domestic taxes and pay as you earn (PAYE) have surpassed targets.

July collections were Sh152.85 billion while August and September collections were Sh138.91 billion and Sh184.87 billion respectively.
