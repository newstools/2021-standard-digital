KQ palne branded with image of a Rhino [Courtesy]  Kenya Airways (KQ) has entered into a partnership with the Kenya Tourism Board to brand planes with images of wildlife to promote Kenya as a tourist destination.  The campaign will also renew KQ’s commitments in the fight against illegal wildlife trade and support conservation efforts to protect endangered wildlife.  Two planes, a Dreamliner and an Embraer, now bear images of Kenya’s most iconic species: rhinos, elephants and a lion.  This, said the airline, will create visibility for Kenya across the airline’s network and position the country as a “must visit” destination.  Balala: Aged Kenyans to visit Nairobi National park for free  Sh3.5b EU grant to promote blue economy, tourism at the Coast  No Covid-19 certificate?
