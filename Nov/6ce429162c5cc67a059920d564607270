A former senior Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) staff has been taken to court for allegedly defrauding a truck driver more than Sh15 million.  It is alleged that Hapicha Mamo, who worked as KPA land surveyor, between February 8, 2016 and May 30, 2017 he defrauded Issack Ali Maalim Sh15,540,000 claiming he could sell him 60 acres of land.  Yesterday, the accused denied the charge before Senior Resident Magistrate Ritta Amwai.  Amwai directed that Mamo be detained at the Mikindani Police Station tomorrow when she will make a ruling on his bond application.    Have the job done or get back Sh120m, MPs tell port bosses  KPA dominate KBF Premier League action  Basketball: Teenager Okot drops 15 points as KPA blowout Strathmore University  Basketball: Achieng upbeat as KPA travel to play Strathmore State prosecutor Annette Wanjohi opposed Mamo’s application to be released on bail, saying he was a flight risk.  Wanjohi said the suspect had on several occasions failed to report to the police station despite being summoned.  He said the police had tried to trace Mamo in Mombasa, Moyale and Nairobi without success. His phone was switched off.  He was eventually arrested in KCB Apartments along Jogoo Road in Nairobi.  The prosecution said that Mamo's phone signal had been traced to the Moyale border several times, and that the police fear he may flee to Somali.  However, Mamo denied he was a flight risk. He also said he is asthmatic.
