And then we heard a loud bang, and just deafening cries and screams from people who are struck by the vehicle," BBC reports.  Chief Thompson said officers had recovered a suspect vehicle and a person of interest was in custody, but gave no further details. He added the investigation was "very fluid".  Fire chief Steven Howard told the press that his department had taken 11 adults and 12 children to nearby hospitals after the incident.   One person is in custody. The incident does not appear to be an act of terrorism at this time, officials say.  The suspect appeared to have been fleeing another scene when he ran into people at the parade, a law enforcement official familiar with the early findings of the investigation told the BBC's US partner CBS News.
