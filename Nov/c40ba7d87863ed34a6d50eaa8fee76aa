"The traders use the bags to package fruits, vegetables and other food items. They will face prosecution," Nyandoro said.  The 11 included nine businesspeople and a driver of a lorry and his turn boy.  Nema said they were arrested because they did not have documents allowing them to transport waste.  "The lorry has an open back meant to carry sand. It was not designed to transport waste," he said.  The suspects are expected to be arraigned and charged with their respective offences.  Nema banned manufacturing, distribution, sale, and usage of single-use carrier bags in February 2017. The ban took effect on August 28 that year.  Nyandoro said plastic bags continue to pose serious health threats to animals and humans.
