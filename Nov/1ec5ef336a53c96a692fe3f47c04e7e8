Several months after the government sent truckloads of heavily armed security officers to the troubled Laikipia, law-abiding residents of the county are still being butchered by marauding criminals.  In the latest incident, three residents of Githiga Ward have been killed, reportedly by bandits from the neighbouring Baringo County.  This has led panicked residents of Eighteen, Matwiku and Mbogoini villages to start fleeing their homes. The question is, are our security agencies unable to tackle the rampant insecurity in Laikipia? We refuse to believe that that is the case.  It is the work of the government to protect its citizens by all means possible. It must prove that it is up to the task.  Bandits kill three police officers, injure two others in Laikipia conservancy  Lamu Senator Anwar Loitiptip to spend night in police custody  Trench to mitigate banditry, human-wildlife conflict in Laikipia  Scars of banditry in Kerio Valley: How attacks have yielded widows and poverty  CS Fred Matiang'i says the Government is committed to addressing the insecurity in Laikipia County  Kamket Kizimbani: Mbunge wa Tiaty amekamatwa jana kuhusiana na mapigano eneo la Laikipia  Laikipia county Gov't enters into a lease agreement to enable it scale-up infrastructure development By Editorial | 6 hours ago By Editorial | 1 day ago By Editorial | 2 days ago By Editorial | 3 days ago
