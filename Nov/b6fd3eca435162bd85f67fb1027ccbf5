National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) and the European Union (EU) have launched a campaign aimed at reducing road accidents.  The campaign dubbed ‘Usalama Barabarani’ aims at enhancing safety on the roads by cultivating responsible behaviour. It will involve sensitisation focused on behaviour change among motorists and other road users.  NTSA Director Catherine Waweru said they plan to engage students from various schools.  “The programme targets youth who form the bulk of the country’s population. We want to cultivate a culture of responsible use of roads,” said Ms Waweru, who spoke at St Peter’s Academy Lanet in Nakuru County during the launch of the programme.  Waweru said improper use of roads was the main cause of accidents that are killing and maiming many.  Market day turns tragic after 11 killed, scores injured in accident  Kericho accident leaves two dead, 30 injured  Sh240 factory gives hope for cashew nut farmers at Coast  Road deaths worrying “Some motorists are careless. They behave as if they own the roads. They want to push other users off the roads and that has resulted in accidents.”  Rift Valley Police Staff Operations Commander Simon Birir said road accidents are on the rise.     NTSA yasema matatu zilipuuza maagizo  NTSA suspends a Matatu SACCO license: Lastest in Kisumu in the fight againts COVID-19  Hafla ya NTSA kukabidhi magari 17 kwa Trafiki kuongozwa na Inspekta Hillary Mutyambai By Kennedy Gachuhi | 1 hour ago By Jacob Ng’etich | 3 hours ago By Phares Mutembei | 21 hours ago By Lynn Kolongei | 1 day ago
