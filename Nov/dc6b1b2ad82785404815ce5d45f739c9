Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan and her Uganda President Yoweri Museveni on Sunday addressed an oil and gas conference organised by the private sector to discuss opportunities presented by the 1,445km East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) project.  The $3.5 billion (Sh393.7 billion) EACOP project is being jointly implemented by the two East African neighbouring countries, connecting Uganda's oil fields at Hoima to Tanzania's port of Tanga on the Indian Ocean.   Museveni — who was on a three-day official visit to Tanzania — and her host Suluhu addressed the closing session of the conference in the commercial capital Dar es Salaam.  A statement issued by Tanzania's Directorate of Presidential Communications at State House said President Suluhu urged experts from Tanzania and Uganda to work closely toward the implementation of the project.   "Experts from both countries should work together in resolving challenges that are likely to affect smooth implementation of the project," she said.    Museveni identifies 3 terrorists who blew themselves up in Kampala  Succession in Uganda   Uganda to reopen schools, economy in January 2022, Museveni says  DP Ruto asks Museveni to release Kenyan lorries  President Uhuru among world leaders who attended the inauguration of President Yoweri Museveni  Museveni ameapishwa kwa muhula wa sita, Kumng'atua Mohamud, Tahadhari ya Covid-19 | MBIU YA KTN  President Suluhu will on Tuesday begin a two-day State visit on the invitation of President Kenyatta By Reuters | 10 hours ago By Reuters and Winfrey Owino | 11 hours ago By Betty Njeru | 2 days ago By Reuters | 2 days ago
