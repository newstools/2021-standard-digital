Embattled Speaker Justin Nkaduda was yesterday barred from accessing his office despite a court order allowing him to resume work.  There was push and pull between the MCAs and Nkaduda as he was blocked from entering his office.  The speaker reached the compound unnoticed but was in for a rude shock when the security guards refused to let him into his office following an order from authorities.  Nkaduda was left stranded as he sought permission to serve the court order to the assembly.  While addressing the press at the main gate, Nkaduda accused Deputy Speaker Sadam Hussein and a few MCAs of causing disunity among the members of the assembly by ignoring lawful orders.  Tana River MCAs impeach Speaker Justin Nkaduda   When dead cats turned up inside Tana River County Assembly  Tana River MCAs impeach Speaker Justin Nkaduda   When dead cats turned up inside Tana River County Assembly "Why is the deputy speaker who is an elected leader behaving in this manner? If he wants to be the speaker he should resign first and then contest for the position," he said.  Efforts to reach Hussein were futile as his phone was off.  There was tension at the county government offices when security personnel took positions to ensure that the speaker did not reach his office.  Some police officers had barricaded roads heading to the county assembly.  In the afternoon, residents who had converged at the county assembly called on the embattled speaker to seek an alternative way to resolve the impasse.  They said he should hold a meeting with the members instead of using force to try to access his office.  Nkaduda claims since his removal, various Bills have been passed without much scrutiny.      By Joackim Bwana | 7 hours ago By Renson Mnyamwezi | 7 hours ago By Ishaq Jumbe | 12 hours ago By Peterson Githaiga | 1 day ago
