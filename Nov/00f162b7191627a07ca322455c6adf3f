Mosop took the plea after a mental assessment done at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital indicated that she was fit to stand trial.  Justice Ogola directed that the probation officers work on a report within two weeks before the court rules on bond terms.  The body was moved to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital mortuary.  A postmortem conducted on the deceased at the MTRH revealed that he died of intoxication, with the report showing that the pathologist finding would undergo further investigations.  The court will rule on the bond application on December 15.
