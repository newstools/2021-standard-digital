Homa Bay Bay Police Station [James Omoro, Standard]  A quarrel between a 38-year-old man and his niece over the theft of chicken ended tragically.  Stephen Omala died at Kowuor Bondo Village, Korayo Sub-location in Rangwe Sub-county on Monday night after allegedly being cut by the niece aged 23.  According to the Assistant Chief of Korayo Alloys Odhiambo, Omala suspected that someone was stealing his chicken and taking them to his brother's home.  Trouble began on Monday evening when he went to his brother's home to ask for them. The squabble led to a physical fight, with each of them trying to be in control of a panga they both held. It was not clear who first produced the panga.   The woman reportedly overpowered her uncle. "She cut Omala's hand, leading to excessive bleeding," said Mr Odhiambo.  Omala returned to his home and died as his family made efforts to take him to hospital.   The woman was arrested on Tuesday morning and taken to Homa Bay police station. Homa Bay Sub-County Directorate of Criminal Investigations commander Monica Berege said they were investigating the matter.
