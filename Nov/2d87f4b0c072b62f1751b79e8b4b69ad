A sombre mood engulfed three villages in Mbeere North, Embu County after 11 people died in a road accident yesterday morning.  The Eastern Regional coordinator Isaiah Nakoru said most of the victims were elderly men and women from Gangara, Ndutori and Kivwe villages who were heading to the sub-county headquarters to register for the Inua Jamii cash transfer programme.  He said the 21-passenger bus, which belongs to Ketno Sacco, had carried 61 people, and had been declared unroadworthy by the National Transport Services Authority last year.  The Sub-County Police Commander Kivinda Kilonzo said the driver was trying to jump-start the bus, which reversed and rolled several times.  “The accident occurred at the Thura bridge on the way from Gangara area towards Siakago town. It ran out of fuel and after refueling, the driver tried to start the bus but it couldn’t,” said Kilonzo.  NTSA and Europe launch campaign to cut road accidents  Land dispute: Murang’a family to cremate parents, sister   MP Nassir staff killed in road accident  Two killed in Migaa road accident Police are looking for the driver, who escaped after the accident, and the owner of the vehicle.
