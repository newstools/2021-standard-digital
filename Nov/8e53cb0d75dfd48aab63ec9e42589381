Police reports indicated that both sustained injuries after the fight. Ekai would succumb to stab wounds in the chest while receiving treatment at MTRH, the police said.  The two are said to have fought after Ekai, who worked as a guard with a private security firm, accused Kipkoech of planning to sabotage him and take over his job.  Kipkoech was treated and discharged before he was arrested by officers from Eldoret Police Station.  The court directed that a probation report be prepared for consideration of the bond application made by the accused.  Justice Ogola directed that the suspect be remanded at Eldoret GK Prison until December 16, when a ruling on his bond application will be delivered.    Murder Mystery: FBI joins investigations into the disappearance & murder of Bashir Mohammed  Police detain a couple and their son for allegedly beating their 15-year-old daughter to death  Nyeri Murder Probe: Nyeri tycoon accused of killing his own son over domestic quarrel between them By James Munyeki | 2 hours ago By Irissheel Shanzu | 3 hours ago By Nikko Tanui | 3 hours ago By Lynn Kolongei | 4 hours ago
