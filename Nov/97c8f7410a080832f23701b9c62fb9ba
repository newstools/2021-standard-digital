Police were deployed to restore normalcy in Kondele Ward, Kisumu Central Sub-County. [Harold Odhiambo, Standard]  A crowd has disrupted Deputy President William Ruto’s Wednesday tour of Kondele Ward in Kisumu Central Sub-County. Ruto is in Kisumu to sell his presidential agenda.   As he passed through Kondele, some youth pelted his convoy with stones. Police officers in at least four Toyota Land Cruiser vehicles were deployed to the scene to restore normalcy.    When Ruto was addressing the crowd from his vehicle’s sunroof, a section of rowdy youth then started heckling him. The DP was forced to cut short his speech which had lasted barely five minutes.  Police: DP Ruto had been warned to avoid Kondele over tension  Political parties shouldn’t be tribe-based – DP William Ruto  Handshake derailed our dream, Ruto tells Raila turf  Prepare to accept next year's poll results, Raila allies now tell Ruto Police engaged the youth in running battles, with teargas hurled to disperse the crowd.
