The Kenya Climate Innovation Centre (KCIC) will set up business incubation hubs in Bungoma, Isiolo, Kiambu, Kilifi, Kisii, Machakos, Meru and Uasin Gishu counties under the Agribusiness Programme.  KCIC Corporate Services Manager Ernest Chitechi told a stakeholders’ forum in Kisii yesterday women and youth are hindered from engaging in agribusiness due to, among other things, low returns, inadequate skills and limited access to land.  “Vision 2030 projects agriculture as one of the key sectors capable of transforming the economy to achieve 10 per cent annual growth. Sustaining this milestone requires transforming agriculture from subsistence to innovative, technology-driven and commercially oriented enterprise,” said Mr Chitechi.  Lobby group sues minister over State jobs  Ways to make Kazi Mtaani programme beneficial to Kenya’s youth  Address voter apathy among the youth  Leaders’ promise to fund welfare state is a pipe dream  He said the new programme would help improve the productivity of smallholder farmers, thereby increasing incomes and creating 20,000 direct and indirect jobs. Chitechi said the programme has so far attracted 25,875 applications.      Amos Kimunya urges youth groups and women to embrace empowerment programs  Baringo BBI Bill: KANU youth condemn chaos that rocked the BBI bill debate at the County Assembly  Women In Business: Focus on an entrepreneur who manufactures nail polish locally By Dominic Omondi | 30 minutes ago By Antony Gitonga | 10 hours ago By Graham Kajilwa | 12 hours ago By Macharia Kamau | 15 hours ago
