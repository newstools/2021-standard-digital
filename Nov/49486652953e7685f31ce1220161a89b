Police are investigating an incident in which a 70-year-old man stabbed his wife to death after they reportedly differed over Sh6,000 they had raised from the sale of a goat.  According to the Embu East sub-County Police Commander Benjamin Muhia, the 42-year-old woman is said to have taken off with the money only to return to their home in Thau village drunk and with no money left.  "I received a call around 12.50pm informing me of what had happened. When I arrived at the scene, I found members of the public who wanted to lynch the suspect," said area chief Daniel Ndwiga.  Some neighbours said the couple had been having problems and had a case that was due for adjudication at the chief's office this week.   Embu Police Station OCS summoned for not presenting suspect  Suspect stabs officer who had gone to arrest him  Embu ready to host KICOSCA Games next week  Embu OCS summoned for holding suspect beyond 24 hours  Bodaboda rider detained over the brutal stabbing of two teenagers that left one of them dead  Utata wa Ardhi Embu: Viongozi walaani ubomoaji huku maelfu wakiachwa bila makao  Nabbed for Sodomy: Police in Embu hold paedophile suspect after he allegedly defiled nephew aged 12 By Boniface Gikandi | 7 hours ago By Mwaniki Muriithi | 7 hours ago By Kipsang Joseph | 10 hours ago By Boniface Gikandi | 1 day ago
