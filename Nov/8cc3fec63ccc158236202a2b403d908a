Amani National Congress (ANC) has elected John Kubai as their new Meru County chairman.  Mr Kubai assured the residents that the party would hold free, fair and transparent nominations. Kubai, who was flanked by former PNU Nominated MCA Margaret Ntongai and who has expressed interest in the Woman representative position, said they had embarked on a campaign to drum up support for Musalia Mudavadi as the ideal presidential candidate in the area.  Kubai said Mudavadi had performed well as local government and finance minister and was a peace-loving leader.  “The ANC values the involvement of youth in national leadership. Our secretary-general (Simon Kamau) is a young person. I am also in my early 30s.  About 40 per cent of national officials of ANC are youthful. As young people, we are convinced Mudavadi represents our aspirations, and we want him to be president next year,” Kubai said.  Tackle teen pregnancies  Rights groups plan Friday protests over abductions  Man United have no plans to replace Ole Gunnar Solskjaer  Five English clubs granted safe standing licenses from January 2022  Musalia Mudavadi is expected in Meru county in his heightened political activities to woo the region  Muungano wa NASA umevunjika rasmi baada ya ANC, Wiper na Ford Kenya kutangaza kujiondoa kwao  Raila Odinga has given the clearest indication yet that he is ready to work with One Kenya Alliance By Phares Mutembei | 12 hours ago By James Munyeki | 4 days ago By Muriithi Mugo | 4 days ago By Paul Ogemba | 4 days ago
