DCI boss George Kinoti. [File, Standard]  The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) boss George Kinoti has been sentenced to four months in jail for contempt of court.  Kinoti defied court orders directing him to return businessman Jimi Wanjigi’s guns, which were confiscated from his Muthaiga home on October 16, 2017 during a raid by police.  On June 21, 2019, Justice Chacha Mwita ordered Kinoti to return the seven firearms to Wanjigi.  In September this year, Kinoti skipped court for sentencing after he was declared guilty of contempt following a suit filed by Wanjigi.  Mystery of terror suspects escaping Kenya's most guarded prison  Sweet victory for Mwilu as court revokes petitions for her removal  Police recover Sh19m fake cash from Gigiri house, arrest couple  Jimi Wanjigi intensifies quest to win ODM presidential ticket And now, Justice Antony Mrima has sentenced the DCI chief to four months in jail, without the option of fine, over contempt.
