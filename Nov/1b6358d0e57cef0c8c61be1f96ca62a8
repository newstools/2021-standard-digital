The Devolution Empowerment Party (DEP) will be unveiled on November 27 to mobilise residents for the 2022 General Election, Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi has said.  The DEP, according to Kiraitu, will give the Meru and Mount Kenya East region bargaining power.  The new party has inherited the symbol of a bus, which formerly belonged to Kiraitu’s Alliance Party of Kenya that folded to join the Jubilee Party.  While distributing motorbikes and other tools for boda boda operators, Kiraitu said Meru deserved to be respected in the political dispensation and sharing of national resources. “We have more votes than many (counties) and we should be walking with confidence,” he said.    Kiraitu and Munya asked to decamp as DP Ruto ends tour  Ruto: Kiraitu stop forcing orange party boss on voters  Kiraitu Murungi party to endorse Governor Muriithi as Raila deputy  Raila pledges to explore new miraa market Kiraitu was categorical that the party would only rally the community to support the presidential candidate who guarantees them their development interests.   Deputy President William Ruto, ODM leader Raila Odinga and ANC's Musalia Mudavadi have recently visited Meru to court the electorate for 2022 sake.       Focus on Kiraitu Murungi the Governor of Meru County | PERSON OF INTEREST (Part 2)  Focus on Kiraitu Murungi the Governor of Meru County | PERSON OF INTEREST  Gavana wa Meru, Kiraitu Murungi aunga mkono Ripoti ya BBI By Nikko Tanui | 7 hours ago By Gilbert Kimutai | 7 hours ago By Jacob Ngetich and Muriithi Mugo | 7 hours ago By Jacob Ng'etich and Daniel Kariuki | 7 hours ago
