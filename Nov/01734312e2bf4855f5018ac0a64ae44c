Police claim the terror suspect might have been targeting to attack the nightspot on Lang’ata Road. [File, Standard]  Authorities have arrested a terror suspect for allegedly attempting to bribe a policeman in Nairobi.  The suspect, a Somali national, allegedly approached a police officer on patrol at 2am on Saturday, November 13 at the Lang’ata Shopping Centre, and asked for information about a popular Lang’ata Road joint, ostensibly to plan an attack.  “The suspect sought to know on which day of the week a popular joint on Lang’ata Road hosts the largest number of patrons. The [police] officer was puzzled by the questions from the suspect, who posed as an ordinary civilian seeking general information,” the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) said on Twitter.  “When the officer hesitated to respond, the suspect offered a reward of Sh180,000 in exchange for the information that was not forthcoming,” said the DCI.  Wanted: DCI offers Sh10m bounty for five suspected terrorists  Abductions: Muslim leaders seek answers  How elite unit killed Kenya’s most wanted terrorist  Family in desperate search for son facing terrorism charges The police officer became suspicious of the suspect and arrested him.
