Police in Naivasha are pursuing a boda boda operator suspected of killing a pillion passenger.  The operator, who has since gone into hiding, allegedly beat to death the 32-year-old casual labourer on Sunday evening after a disagreement over Sh70 fare.  “We are still looking for the motorcycle operator who beat his passenger to death in Kayole estate. It’s only a matter of time before we get him,” said Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru.  The victim, who was leaving a bar, had asked the rider to ferry him to his home at around 9pm.  John Kimani, a witness, said upon arriving at his home, the passenger could not remember his M-Pesa pin, leading to a confrontation with the boda boda operator.  Officer denies killing lawyer and his client  Man who confessed to killing wife jailed five years  Stepfather fails to stop 20-year jail term for defilement  Sentencing of Catholic priest's killer deferred “In the process, the rider decided to take the drunk passenger to Karai police post, but they disagreed further, leading to a fight,” he said.
