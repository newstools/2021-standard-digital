The sentencing of a man who admitted to killing a Catholic priest in 2019 has been pushed to Thursday.  High Court Judge Lucy Njuguna said the absence of the pre-sentence report had delayed the sentencing of Michael Muthini Mutunga.  "Without a victim assessment report, it cannot take place," Justice Njuguna said.  Leah Mate for the prosecution submitted that the interviews had been carried out but the report was not yet submitted. She asked for another date.  Man who confessed to killing wife jailed five years  Stepfather fails to stop 20-year jail term for defilement  Man found with gun rearrested after escaping his first capture  Man who confessed to killing wife jailed for five years Mutunga is charged with killing Fr Michael Maingi Kyengo on the night between October 8 and 9, 2019 at Makima location, Mbeere Sub-county.
