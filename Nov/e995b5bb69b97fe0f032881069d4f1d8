Committee members led by Yatta MP Charles Kilonzo, who toured the project to assess its implementation and viability, decried the manner in which the contractor undertook his work.  Also present were Rangwe MP Lilian Gogo, Gilgil MP Martha Wangari, Nyaribari Chache MP Richard Nyagaka, Kitui Woman Rep Irene Kasalu, and the Lake Basin Development Authority Managing Director Raymond Omollo.  Kilonzo said they discovered that water was not flowing in some canals whose construction had already been completed.  Rice farmers get Sh100m boost  Sh6b irrigation plan to be completed in June   Rice farmers get Sh100m boost  Sh6b irrigation plan to be completed in June  “The quality of work done is not commensurate to the amount of money spent.
