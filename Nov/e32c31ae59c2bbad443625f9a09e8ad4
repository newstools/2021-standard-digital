The Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops has called out politicians for neglecting their jobs of serving Kenyans and embarking on almost full-time campaigns at a time parts of the country are struggling with famine and poverty.  The clerics have also decried what it allegedly calls “early signs of rigging and manipulation of the forthcoming General Elections” which they attributed to the movement of citizens to register in stations away from their places of residence.  “We remind leaders that if they continue to promote ethnic mobilisation and balkanisation, they risk exposing our country to grave danger,” read the statement.  Further, they called on Parliament to enact the necessary reforms in electoral laws that will guarantee free, fair and credible elections in August 2022.   Spending limits  Proportion of Kenyan adults fully vaccinated now at 7.2pc  Diabetes problem makes Africa more vulnerable to COVID-19 death, says WHO  Safaricom defies Covid-19 to post Sh37b net profit in six months  Covid lifts demand for residential houses with large office spaces On September 30, the National Assembly voted to revoke the Campaign Financing Limits Regulations which would have seen spending limits imposed on aspirants.

The Election Observation Group (ELOG) has also called out parliament for stalling with some reforms in the election laws.   The religious leaders also expressed concern at the increasing disregard of Covid-19 regulations during rallies that pull in thousands of supporters who don’t maintain social distance and some do not have masks on.  “We risk sliding back to a serious infection crisis if this recklessness is not contained,” said the bishops.    Exploring the preparedness and the key timeliness of the IEBC to conduct the 2022 General Elections  Ministry of Health receives 180,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine as a donation from Gov't of Greece  HEALTH WATCH: How Covid-19 misinformation worldwide has created panic by misleading masses By Winfrey Owino | 6 hours ago By Harold Odhiambo and Edwin Nyarangi | 12 hours ago By Jacob Ng'etich | 20 hours ago By Jael Mboga | 22 hours ago
