Police have impounded 20,000 litres of ethanol that was on transit to Nakuru from the border town of Busia.  Nakuru County Police Officer in charge of Operations, Wilson Nduati, said the consignment may have come from a neighbouring country.  “Last night at 9pm, we flagged down a semi-trailer along the Nakuru-Eldoret highway following a tip-off from the public. On board were two suspects and eighty 250-litre drums,” said Nduati.  Nduati said the drums were filled with a liquid suspected to be ethanol, commonly used in the production of liquor.  Officers from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) collected samples of the liquid, as officers from the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) confirmed that no taxes had been paid for the consignment.  Tightened security on Kenya-Uganda border causes heavy traffic [Photos]  I'll defend my seat next year, says Nakuru Governor Kinyanjui  Nakuru households set to benefit from Sh500 million emergency water program   Row erupts over allocation of PSV spaces at new bus terminus  Serikali ya kaunti ya Nakuru yatoa pendekezo la kuzuia uvuvi katika ziwa Naivasha  KENHA urges Kenyans plying the Nairobi-Nakuru highway to use alternative routes  Tussle over the ownership of land in Ngongogeri, Nakuru threatening peace amongst disputing parties By Gilbert Kimutai | 3 hours ago By Irissheel Shanzu | 9 hours ago By Titus Too | 10 hours ago By Kennedy Gachuhi | 10 hours ago
