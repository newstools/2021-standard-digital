Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga in Nairobi on October 7, 2021. [Elvis Ogina, Standard]  Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga has failed to stop a case filed by his deputy Caroline Karugu against him.  Dr Karugu is seeking court orders compelling the governor to release her salary and allowances.  Justice Nzioki wa Makau of the Employment and Labour Relations Court said the court has the power to hear Karugu’s case challenging Kahiga’s decision to withhold her salary amounting to Sh15 million.  In her application, Karugu says her boss has withheld her salary since their fallout in November 2019.  Nyeri Town MP calls for resignation of IEBC's Chebukati  Nyeri Town MP calls for Chebukati's resignation  From Gatina to Gakuyu: Why Nyeri school had to change name  Nyeri siblings refuse to bury brother who squandered wealth Other than her monthly salary of Sh685,250, Karugu accuses her boss of withholding telephone and entertainment allowances. She says the last time she received these allowances was in November 2018.  While striking out the objection by Kahiga and County Secretary Benjamin Gachichio who had challenged the court’s decision to hear the case, Justice Makau ruled that the court would proceed to hear and determine the petition.  Makau said the petition by Karugu was filed in the correct court and was in the right forum.  Gachichio had argued that the deputy governor is not Kahiga’s employee, meaning there is no employee-employer relationship that should be arbitrated.    Mipango ya rufaa ya BBI imetolewa, Wananchi waanza kusajiliwa NHIF Nyeri | MBIU YA KTN  KTDA Elections: Nyeri county tea farmers hold tea director zones elections  Nyeri residents express their opinions to the new Covid-19 measures announced by President Uhuru By Irissheel Shanzu | 10 hours ago By Muriithi Mugo | 10 hours ago By James Omoro | 15 hours ago By Brian Kisanji | 16 hours ago
