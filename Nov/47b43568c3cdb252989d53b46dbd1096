The High Court has extended the voter registration exercise in Eldoret, giving those who haven’t registered a chance to exercise their civic duty by November 9.  This is after an activist from Uasin Gishu County obtained orders from the High Court sitting in Eldoret yesterday, following a successful application under a certificate of urgency.  Issuing the orders, High Court Judge Eric Ogola said the exercise is to continue until November 9 when the application filed by Patrick Toroitich Cherono is heard.  “Pending the hearing and determination of the application, a prohibitory order be and is hereby issued prohibiting the first respondent (IEBC) or its agents acting under its authority from closing the national voter registration exercise,” reads the order.  Cherono, in his petition, sought orders from the court to compel the IEBC to continue with the mass registration to allow more citizens to register. Cherono, through his lawyer Kaira Nabasenge, said that since the IEBC launched the mass voter registration, which targeted at least 4.5 million new registered voters on October 4, only 760,000 new voters have been registered across the country.  Handicapped woman, 56, beats all odds to register as a voter  IEBC says it won’t extend voter registration  What voters should consider while choosing next president  Like Namibia, Kenya can build the best social protection programme in Africa He told the court that bearing in mind challenges brought about the Covid-19 pandemic, Kenyans who have attained 18 years should be given ample time to exercise their right of registering as voters.  Cherono indicated that it is now apparent that despite the low voter turnout, the electoral commission may not extend the mass voter registration citing financial constraints.  newsdesk@standardmedia.co.ke          ODM’s attempt to oust Chebukati from IEBC elicits mixed reactions | INSIDE POLITICS WITH BEN KITILI  Exploring the preparedness and the key timeliness of the IEBC to conduct the 2022 General Elections  IEBC launches 2020-2024 Strategic Plan ahead of the 2022 general elections By Winfrey Owino | 37 minutes ago By Amos Kareithi | 1 hour ago By Paul Ogemba | 5 hours ago By Betty Njeru | 6 hours ago
