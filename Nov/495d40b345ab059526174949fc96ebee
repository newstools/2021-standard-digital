Scene of the crime [Courtesy]  Police are looking for a 25-year-old woman who stabbed another woman after clashing in a man's house in Subukia.  Speaking to The Standard, Subukia Police Commander Patricia Nasio said that the suspect vanished minutes after stabbing Bernice Wangeci, 21, on Tuesday morning.  “We received a report of an assault case from the residents on Tuesday at around 1am. The case turned fatal after the victim was pronounced dead hours later. The suspect is now on the run,” said Nasio.  The drama started after Stephen Chege arrived at his house accompanied by the suspect at around 1am and found Wanjiru in the house. An altercation between the two ensued as they argued on who was rightfully in Chege’s house, leading to the suspect picking a kitchen knife and attacking Wangeci as the man watched.  Businessman stabbed to death while closing his shop  Form Four student stabbed to death in nightclub row over woman  Woman pleads guilty to stabbing her boyfriend to death, seeks lesser charge of manslaughter  Prayer village where believers and non-believers find solace The police boss added that Chege rushed Wangeci to Subukia Sub County Hospital leaving the suspect in the house.  “Wangeci was pronounced dead on arrival at the health facility.
