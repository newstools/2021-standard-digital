Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered a reprisal after Tigray People Liberation Front (TPLF) soldiers attacked a military base. In the ensuing civil war, more than two million people have been displaced and thousands killed.  Reports coming out of Ethiopia indicate that TPLF fighters are advancing on Addis Ababa. In itself, this is disheartening because the move will translate to more suffering for innocent people. There is urgent need for regional governments and the African Union to raise their voices and call for an end to this conflict before the situation gets out of hand. The need for round-table talks to resolve the long-standing dispute between Abiy Ahmed’s legitimate government and TPLF cannot be gainsaid.     Uhuru’s passionate plea to Ethiopia PM to end conflict  Inciting civilians will fan the conflict, Ethiopia's Abiy Ahmed told  Police heighten security along Kenya’s borders following Ethiopia unrest  Joint UN, Ethiopia rights team: all sides committed abuses in Tigray  Safaricom enters Ethiopian market; it will partner with Vodafone  11 Ethiopians imprisoned for 6 months after being found guilty of being in the country illegally  Kenya-Ethiopia Ties: Uhuru and Ethiopian PM officiated new border post set to bolster trade ties By Editorial | 30 minutes ago By Editorial | 1 day ago By Editorial | 1 day ago By Editorial | 2 days ago
