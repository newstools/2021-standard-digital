Judge's gavel and handcuffs [Courtesy]  Five policemen accused of killing a man at Kochia village in Homa Bay County, four years ago, have finally been charged with murder.  Michael Ochango, Silas Anyira, Bernard Maritim, Steven Owino and Wycliffe Chepto, appeared in court on Wednesday to face charges for allegedly causing the death of Sylvanus Owinji, a suspect they had arrested on September 17, 2017.  A warrant of arrest has been issued against a sixth officer, Edwin Moenga, who has since exited the National Police Service. Owinji died at Homa Bay Referral Hospital where he was taken after the duty officer at Rangwe Police Station declined to place him in custody due to his injuries. That was a day after his arrest.  Independent Policing Oversight Authority (Ipoa) would later launch investigations into Owinji’s death. It was established that the officers raided Owinji’s home on suspicion that he was dealing in bhang. “During the arrest, the officers used force and Owinji sustained injuries which a pathologist determined to be the cause of death,” said Ipoa in a statement.  Human-wildlife conflict impeding livestock rearing in Homa Bay  Police probe death of a farm manager  Farm manager lynched over land dispute allegations  Melly and Chumba emerge winners in National Beach volleyball     Woman in Homa Bay loses hand in domestic violence over suspicion of dating another man  Kiswahili cha kipekee cha Gavana wa Homa Bay, Cyprian Awiti | MIRINDIMI  Homa Bay County Government comes to the rescue of displaced Karachuonyo flood victims By James Omoro | 16 hours ago By James Omoro | 2 days ago By James Omoro | 2 days ago By Collins Kweyu | 3 days ago
