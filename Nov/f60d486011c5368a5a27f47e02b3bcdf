Meanwhile, the EU delegation stated that the EU intends to continue providing humanitarian assistance to Afghan women, men and children in need, according to the humanitarian principles of humanity, independence, impartiality and neutrality to ensure access to those in need, read the statement.  It further reported that both sides expressed their commitment to the territorial integrity of a sovereign Afghanistan, at peace with itself and with its neighbours, interacting with the international community based on national sovereignty and mutual respect and recognition of all its national and international responsibilities.  "In response to the EU delegation's request for Afghanistan to take determined action to fight all forms of terrorism, the Afghan delegation reaffirmed its commitment not to allow the territory of Afghanistan to serve as a base for hosting and financing of any person or group that threatens the security of others, and to take firm action also against groups inside the country trying to carry out such acts and to hold perpetrators and organisers of such attacks accountable," the statement said.  This dialogue does not imply recognition by the EU of the interim government but is part of EU's operational engagement, in the interest of the EU and the Afghan people, the statement added.    EACC yashirikiana na umoja wa mataifa wa Uingereza kukomesha ufisadi nchini  News Center Discussion: European Union MPs debates Kenya's 2017 elections  The EU parliament debates Kenya's political state By Reuters | 8 days ago By Reuters | 14 days ago By Agencies | 14 days ago By Agencies | 14 days ago
