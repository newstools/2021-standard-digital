Lokichoggio Airport in Lokichoggio town, Turkana County [Bakari Angela, Standard]  Frequent attacks by a militia from neighbouring South Sudan has added to Kenya's insecurity headache.  In the past three months, raids by the Toposa militia along the Kenya-South Sudan border have left more than 10 people dead and a dozen animals stolen.  And that is not all. They have also disrupted the construction of Lokichoggio-Nadapal road.  It is shameful that a foreign ragtag army can terrorise a country with a powerful security machinery like Kenya —not for a day, but for months. Such transgression and the ongoing bandit attacks in Laikipia, makes Kenyans to question the purported strength of their well-funded security agencies.  Tension in Lokichoggio following militia raids  Tension in Lokichoggio as armed militia storm security camp  Lokichoggio: The ‘ghost town’ with no bank  Senior Immigration officer shot dead in Turkana while on morning run Police and the military must reassure the public by dealing with such threats expeditiously.
