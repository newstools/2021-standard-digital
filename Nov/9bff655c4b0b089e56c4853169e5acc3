Pupils of different secondary schools were thoroughly caned by residents of Kipkorgot in Uasin Gishu County after they failed to report to school. [Kevin Tunoi, Standard]  Corporal punishment should be reintroduced because it will bring back a sense of discipline in our children.  There is a misconception in today's society’s that children can do whatever they want and face no consequences.  Values are now becoming a thing of the past and degraded morals are what we are seeing in our learning institutions and even our homes.  All these because we have encouraged the idea that a little punishment to correct a mistake is child abuse. No.  Why the cane won’t stop school fires  Five students linked to dorm fires in Homa Bay arrested  Police crack mystery of five dorms burnt in one school  State won't rebuild school property destroyed in arson Proverbs 13:24 says: “Those who spare the rod of discipline hate their children. Those who love their children care enough to discipline them.” It advises us to discipline our children and guide them in the way they should go.   We should instill the right values and morals in them so that they can become good citizens.  Corporal punishment is NOT a form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment towards our children. It is guiding them towards the right path.  It made us the people we are today. Let us do justice to our children and the generations to come.
