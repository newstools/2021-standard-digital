Police vehicle patrol Ol moran Shopping Centre in Laikipia County on September 9, 2021 [Harun Wathari, Standard]  The government has banned members of the public from carrying weapons, such as knives and clubs, in towns within Laikipia County.  County Police Commander John Nyoike said the ban came into force yesterday and anyone found with such items will risk being arrested and prosecuted.  Nyoike said the move is aimed at taming increasing cases of attacks and threats by individuals against one another in some trading centres, including Rumuruti, Ol-Moran and Dol dol.  “This is a trend that we have witnessed in the last few months. People attack each other especially on market days and that is why we have issued the ban,” said Nyoike.  Former Laikipia North MP jailed for 12 months over assault  Ranches: How much land can one own or cede?  Multi agency team to help foster peace in troubled Laikipia  End Laikipia killing spree   He said introduction of the new measures will provide the police with further means to help deter young people from becoming involved in knife possession and knife crimes.
