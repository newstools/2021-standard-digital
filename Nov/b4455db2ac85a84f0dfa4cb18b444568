Herders with their cattle at one of the ranches in Laikipia County on March 10, 2017. [Kipsang Joseph, Standard]  Two Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) soldiers were killed in Laikipia yesterday. The shooting came hours after other bandits killed two General Service Unit officers at Ngerecha, Laikipia West Sub-county.  When the hunters become the hunted, we must start asking the hard questions. Who are these individuals brave enough to attack police and army officers in broad daylight? Where do illiterate bandits get police operations intelligence and superior arms to those used by the police?  The Laikipia problem might run deeper than the government is willing to admit. Ideally, security officers are supposed be on top of the situation, but as things stand, they are on the receiving end. Tables must be turned on the bandits. Instigators of the violence should be apprehended and charged.     Is KDF involvement in civilian roles legally justified?  Two KDF soldiers killed, several injured in Laikipia  Military, NYS to oversee KEMSA operations  ‘Fake’ KDF officers detained to allow investigations  Fake KDF calling letters; 55 recruits arrested at Moi Barracks Recruits Training School  EACC yadai kufanya ukaguzi fedha za KDF ili kuziba miaya ya matumizi mabaya  Shughuli ya kuwateua vijana wanaotaka kujiunga na jeshi limeng'oa nanga hii leo mjini Kwanza By Glory Chigogo  | 25 minutes ago By Dr John Kakonge | 10 hours ago By John Tanui | 10 hours ago By Jeremy Nyanga | 10 hours ago
