Former Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu follows proceedings at the anti-corruption court in Milimani on Monday, November 2, 2020. [Collins Kweyu, Standard]  Former Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu was yesterday charged afresh in a Sh588million corruption case.   This follows a ruling by the magistrate’s court allowing the Director of Public Prosecution Noordin Haji to amend the charge sheet and introduce new evidence against him.  Anti-Corruption Court Chief Magistrate Thomas Nzyoki directed the former governor, his wife Susan Wangari and their nine co-accused to be charged again after allowing an application by the prosecution that sought to add more charges and introduce new evidence.  “In the interest of justice, I find that the application by the Director of Public Prosecutions has merit and the court allows it,” ruled Nzyoki.  Sonko Leaks: Justice Chitembwe speaks out [Exclusive]  Six corruption suspects charged with embezzling Sh85 million  Public service spirit, what’s that?
