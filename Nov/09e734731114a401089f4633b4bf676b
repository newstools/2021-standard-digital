The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said it has reached an agreement with Pakistan that will help revive a stalled $6 billion (over Sh673.5 billion) funding programme for the South Asian country, which faces growing economic challenges.  "The Pakistani authorities and IMF staff have reached a staff-level agreement on policies and reforms needed to complete the sixth review," the IMF said in a statement.  "The agreement is subject to approval by the Executive Board, following the implementation of prior actions, notably on fiscal and institutional reforms."  It said completion of the review would make available 750 million in IMF special drawing rights, or approximately $1.059 billion, bringing total disbursements so far to about $3.027 billion.     Massive layoffs cap IMF’s release of Sh29 billion facility to Kenya  Pakistan Airlines suspends Afghan operations, citing Taliban interference  India, Pakistan: Two opposing visions of Afghanistan  IMF board to grill MD on data-rigging claims this week  Raia 9 wa Pakistan wakamatwa na polisi Mombasa  Murtaza Ahmedi is now playing in the streets of in Quetta, Pakistan  Kenya seeks precautionary loan By Reuters | 6 days ago By Agencies | 7 days ago By Agencies | 7 days ago By Agencies | 14 days ago Father of four joins KDF after 15 years of failed attempts
