Kisii GK Prisons Wardens and their families party at the facility on October 22, 2021. [Sammy Omingo, Standard]  Going by the Ministry of Health's statistics, Covid-19 cases are on a downwards trajectory. Yesterday, only 20 new Covid-19 cases were recorded in 24 hours from a sample of 3,444.  This is encouraging. But it doesn't mean that we are out of the woods. Sadly, Kenyans across the country are behaving as if the pandemic is now behind us.  Politicians gunning for positions in the 2022 elections and their crowds of supporters particularly continue to set a bad example. While the Covid-19 protocols were relaxed recently, that did not give anyone the licence to go back to normal. For that reason, it is incumbent upon the politicians to remind those who attend their meetings to wear face masks and as much as possible, keep social distance. As they seek to boost their support base, politicians should be careful not to beef up Covid-19 numbers.   Covid-19: Close to 2 million Kenyans fully vaccinated as 20 test positive  Kemsa staff now locked out of office ICT system  Travelling abroad amid Covid-19 restrictions is no walk in the park  Kenyan made opera staged at national theatre  Ministry of Health receives 180,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine as a donation from Gov't of Greece  HEALTH WATCH: How Covid-19 misinformation worldwide has created panic by misleading masses  KEMRI makes a breakthrough in the fight against Covid-19 by developing a Virus Transport Media (VTM) By Editorial | 11 hours ago By Editorial | 1 day ago By Editorial | 4 days ago By Editorial | 4 days ago
