The body of the woman was found hanging from a tree near the trading centre.  Ann Macharia said the woman had for some time threatened to take her life as she was not ready to share the man with another person.  “We talked to her and she reassured us that she would not commit suicide but we were shocked on learning that she had taken her life using a rope,” she said.  Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru confirmed both cases, noting the bodies were taken to the Naivasha Sub-county Hospital mortuary.
