The petitioner is seeking the introduction of 'none of the above' option on ballot papers. [File, Standard]  A petitioner has moved to court, seeking the introduction of “none of the above” option on ballot papers.  Boniface Mwai filed his petition at the Nakuru High Court on Friday, November 12.  Mwai argues that the box will provide 360-degree options for voters.  “That option (none of the above) allows voters who do not have confidence in the listed candidates to exercise their democratic right by indicating that none of the aspirants has won them over,” he said.  Ruto pledges Sh50b kitty for small traders  Raila and Ruto must rein in their troops to avert chaos  Eastern bloc will help produce State House winner, says Kalonzo Musyoka  Governors in Kalonzo Musyoka's turf resolve to embrace Raila Odinga The petitioner wants the court to compel the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) to introduce that option on ballot papers, starting with the 2022 General Election.
