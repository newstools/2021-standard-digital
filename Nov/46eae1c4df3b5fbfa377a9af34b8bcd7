Kenya needs to plant two billion trees to attain 10 per cent tree cover.  Dr Eston Mutitu, Regional Director and Chief Research Scientist, Kenya Forestry Research Institute (Kefri) said the trees will ensure a better and wealthy environment that will help mitigate climate change.  He says raising the country’s forest cover requires the collective effort of various partners and individuals.   “For Kenya to attain 10 per cent tree cover, it is calculated that we should plant two billion trees. If we manage, COP26 will not be mere talk but a reality for Kenya. We will address and mitigate effects of climate change through tree planting,” Mutitu said during the launch of Nairobi Fruity City Project by Fruity Schools Africa at Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital.  Kennedy Odoyo, Project Director, Fruity Schools Africa, said they aim to provide fresh fruits and make the city green.  Tree planting drive now gathers speed  Plant Your Age initiative makes strides in achieving forest cover  Plant Your Age initiative makes strides in achieving forest cover  Two billion tree seedlings needed to attain 10 per cent forest cover by 2025 He praised the Standard Group for supporting their work.
