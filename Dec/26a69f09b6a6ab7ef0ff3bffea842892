Logs of wood [Courtesy]  Residents of Kiptenden village in Kipkelion West constituency confiscated four tonnes of timber illegally harvested in Kiptenden Forest.  The conservationists ambushed the illegal loggers at 2am as they were transporting the hardwood out of the forest in a lorry.  Kipkelion Officer Commanding Police Division Peter Omondi said upon being informed of the incident, he immediately mobilised officers who rushed to the scene.  “The driver sped off but we have the registration lorry’s registration number. It is only a matter of time before we catch up with the driver and the other illegal loggers who have invaded the forest,” he said. Omondi asked the residents to remain vigilant and inform security agencies of any illegal activities.     By Kennedy Gachuhi | 55 minutes ago By Antony Gitonga | 11 hours ago By Lynn Kolongei | 12 hours ago By Kennedy Gachuhi | 13 hours ago Enjoy unlimited access to The Standard website at a 50% discount on the yearly plan.
