Cotu Secretary-general Francis Atwoli. [David Njaaga, Standard]  Cotu Secretary-general Francis Atwoli yesterday called on trade unions to actively participate in next year’s elections.  Atwoli said trade unions should stand up to protect the nation from looters and leaders with questionable character, who are keen to ascend to political office to protect themselves from prosecution.  For years, he said, trade unions have played critical roles in the political process of the country.   Atwoli said trade union officials should not wait until corrupt leaders are elected, and later complain of poor governance.  He said trade unions have the means to mobilise and whip their members into voting a person of integrity.   “Trade unionists must question if the incoming president is someone who will spur the economy in the right direction. He or she must be committed to creating employment opportunities to grow the economy,” he said.   He added that all was set for the Kakamega’s Bukhungu 2 convention that will be held on December 31.  Atwoli said that he has invited all leaders from Western Kenya including Amani National Congress (ANC) party leader Musalia Mudavadi, Ford Kenya’s Moses Wetangula and other leaders.   “We must stop anybody who is a looter, we must stop anybody who is a known thief. We must stop any unscrupulous person, we must stop anybody who has no goodwill for Kenyans,” he said.   Atwoli also termed those disparaging him in matters politics adding that most developed countries attained their independence through trade unions.
