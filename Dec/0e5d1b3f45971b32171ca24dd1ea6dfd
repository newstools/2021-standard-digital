Details of more than half the number of Kenyans who died in the past one year have not been captured in the government’s data system.  Civil Registration Services Secretary Janet Mucheru said only 37 per cent of deaths have been recorded in the past one year compared to 41.6 per cent in 2016.  Speaking on Friday during a stakeholders forum on formulation strategies to improve civil registration and vital statistics in the country, Ms Mucheru said the number of unregistered deaths went up during the Covid-19 pandemic.  “Birth registration is at 83 per cent but death registration is slow. This challenge is mainly in the marginalised counties because most events happen at home and the locals have to cover long distances to register deaths,” she said.  Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho said there have been serious challenges in registration of street families due to lack of basic documentation starting from birth.  Covid-19 certificate: Chanjo text is enough  Insurance claims rise five-fold during Covid-19   Balancing screen-time over the holidays  Covid-19: Kenya records 29 new cases, 22 recoveries in last 24 hours     News Diary: Trouble at Kenya airways as KQ pilots demand full pay, Mudavadi launches ANC digital  WHO says the omicron variant of Covid-19 virus poses high global threat  Ministry of Health receives 180,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine as a donation from Gov't of Greece By Hudson Gumbihi | 25 minutes ago By Antony Gitonga | 6 hours ago By Caleb Atemi | 6 hours ago By Gilbert Kimutai | 6 hours ago
