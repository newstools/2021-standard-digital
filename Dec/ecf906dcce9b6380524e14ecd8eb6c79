The couple will serve 20 years in jail each for causing their child grievous bodily harm. [Muriithi Mugo, Standard]  A man and his second wife have been sentenced by the Embu Court to 20 years in jail each for torturing their child.  The court heard that the couple, on July 2, 2021, tied the 9-year-old boy to a sofa chair, and hit him repeatedly using a dog leash.  After committing the act, they poured cold water on the chair as the minor remained tied to it for two days.   The boys’ siblings later freed him from the seat.  The court was further told that the man and his wife assaulted the boy’s siblings for rescuing him.  The children’s uncle later intervened and filed a formal complaint.  The victim suffered detached nails, swollen arms and pus filled his ears over time.  Embu Senior Resident Magistrate Juliana Ndeng’eri sentenced the two to 20 years in jail each, saying the suspects “do not deserve to be near the children”.  The boy was the biological child of the man’s first wife, who has since moved out of their matrimonial home.  The court heard that the boy was being punished for “visiting his grandmother against the suspects’ wish”.
