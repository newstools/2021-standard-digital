Archbishop Anthony Muheria of the Archdiocese of Nyeri. [Mose Sammy, Standard]  Religious leaders have waded into the controversial Covid-19 vaccination rules issued by the government last week.  Catholic Archbishop Anthony Muheria issued a terse statement after leading Christmas Mass at the Consolata Cathedral in Nyeri.  Muheria said: “If you get a cold, make sure you get checked to confirm so that you don’t spread Covid-19 to others.  “We do not agree with the government’s directive to peg provision of services on vaccination certificates,” Muheria warned.    “You cannot take away the rights of citizens to be served,” he said, referring to the directive by the government that those seeking crucial services must show proof of vaccination.  These facilities include government offices, pubs, nightclubs, museums, indoor markets, banking halls, train services and PSVs.  The government issued the directive despite a court order suspending the requirements. On December 14, Justice Anthony Mrima suspended the directive issued on November 21, pending the hearing and determination of a case filed by Enoch Aura.   By Ndungu Gachane | 10 hours ago By Mose Sammy | 2 days ago By Lydiah Nyawira | 2 days ago By Boniface Gikandi | 2 days ago Enjoy unlimited access to The Standard website at a 50% discount on the yearly plan.
