High Court Judge Teresia Matheka said proper mechanisms and practical solutions need to be put in place to end GBV. The judge, who is also a member of National Council on the Administration of Justice (NCAJ) special task force on children matters noted with concern that many suspects go unpunished because victims people can’t express themselves in courts and relatives shy away from speaking out.  “It is the role of these champions to go and speak to the people in the villages and be a voice for that voiceless person suffering in silence. When a person is abused they are affected psychologically, physically and economically, and they need support,” she said.
