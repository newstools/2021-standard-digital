[Collins Oduor, Standard]  Elders from the Batsotso sub-tribe of the Luhya have maintained that their annual cultural festival will be held on December 31.  The elders said their event - to be held at Esumeya Primary School grounds in Navakholo Constituency - will not interfere with the Bukhungu political meeting.    Speaking to the media, the elders said it was wrong for Cotu Secretary General Francis Atwoli to declare that there should be no other event on that day. “We would like to inform the organisers of Bukhungu II that our cultural event will go on as planned, and it will not interfere with their event,” said Shiroko Shilenje, the Batsotso elders council secretary-general.  Shilenje noted that the cultural event was important as it provided a platform to showcase their cultural practices and traditions, and to interact and learn.   Angry youth disrupted the elders' meeting at Kakamega Golden Inn Hotel. [Benjamin Sakwa, Standard]  The elders’ meeting was disrupted by angry youth and it took Kakamega Central Police Officer Commanding Station Mohamed Godana to calm them down.  Lurambi Sub-County ODM Chairman Joseph Oyolo urged locals to be calm and maintain peace ahead of the Friday meeting.   “No one should threaten anyone and dictate whether or not the meeting should be held,” said Oyolo.
