Kakamega County Government plans to lend cash to small-scale traders in a bid to help them expand their businesses.  At least 800 targeted traders will benefit from an initial allocation of Sh100 million revolving fund initiated by Governor Wycliffe Oparanya's administration.  The money will be released to the beneficiaries through Kakamega County Microfinance Corporation as soft loans.  Governor Oparanya said the allocation was factored in the 2021-2022 financial year budget.  The county chief disclosed that disbursement of the loans has started and urged traders to take advantage of the initiative to apply for the money to grow their businesses. "Traders can get a minimum loan of Sh20,000 and a maximum of Sh100,000 at an interest rate of just eight per cent," said Oparanya during a consultative meeting with traders in Kakamega town.  Additionally, Oparanya said that his government has managed to construct multi-million modern markets across the 12 sub-counties to offer traders a friendly working environment.   By Osinde Obare | 2 hours ago By Benard Lusigi | 18 hours ago By Martin Ndiema | 1 day ago By Robert Amalemba | 1 day ago Enjoy unlimited access to The Standard website at a 50% discount on the yearly plan.
