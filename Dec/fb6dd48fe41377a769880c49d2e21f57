He argued that the court should maintain the cash bail of Sh50,000 he had been granted earlier before he was re-arrested.  The lawyer told the court that before his client’s arrest, the DCI was not aware that the MP had a cash bail of Sh50,000. Kizito is accused of damaging a family’s property including two semi-permanent houses and a wooden fence worth Sh200,000 in a land dispute at Vikutsa village in Shinyalu, Kakamega East.      Mauaji Shinyalu: Mwanamme anazuiliwa na Polisi kwa madai ya kumpiga na kumuua mkewe  Polisi kizimbani, Azma ya kuwakinga madaktari, Mzozo wa Ardhi, Mauaji Shinyalu | Mbiu ya KTN  Wizi wa kuni umesababisha kijana mmoja kumuua mke wa nduguye By Olivia Odhiambo | 4 hours ago By Benard Lusigi | 1 day ago By John Shilitsa | 1 day ago By Benard Lusigi | 2 days ago
