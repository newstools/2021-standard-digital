Rift Valley Regional Commissioner George Natembeya has urged local administrators and elders to be in the forefront in tackling banditry in West Pokot, Elgeyo Marakwet and Baringo counties.  Speaking at Kolowa AIC church during a peace meeting, which was attended by county commissioners, deputy county commissioners, assistant county commissioners, chiefs and elders from the three counties, he regretted that lives continue to be lost within the valley.  At least 80 people have been killed this year alone.  “Assistant county commissioners should put chiefs to task to make sure that peace is attained within the three counties, it is your mandate to act and report these crimes on time,” Natembeya said.  He warned administrators who fail to report attacks, adding that they risk losing their jobs. West Pokot County Commissioner Appolo Okelo said that when peace is kept, people become highly productive hence improving their livelihoods.  “Chiefs and elders should spearhead peace initiatives."
