Even after the change of guard at Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa) and promises of better services, the agency continues to disappoint. West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo has complained that there are still delays in the supply of drugs and other medical supplies to health facilities.  Such delays have been common for long and needless to say, they cause pain and even death. Prof Lonyangapuo has warned that counties might have no option but to get supplies from elsewhere, rather "sit and watch people suffer”.  After the changes at Kemsa following allegations of massive corruption early this year, Kenyans expected better from the agency. It must deliver.  If it fails to, governors should be granted their wish to source medicines without the involvement of Kemsa. We shouldn't allow anyone to play with the lives of poor Kenyans.
