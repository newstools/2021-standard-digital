Crime Scene [Courtesy]  A woman in Likoni, Mombasa County, is in police custody in connection to the death of her lover.  Police said Maurine Atieno, 32, allegedly stabbed Hamisi Mohamed, 34, at her Shikaadabu house. Mohamed is said to have died on arrival at the Likoni sub-county hospital on Boxing Day.  His friends said Mohamed had a conversation with them moments before he rushed to her lover's house where they engaged in a fierce fight.  The woman was also left with bruises and a swollen face following the fight. Sources claim the woman acted in self-defence, adding that the two lovers fought on several occasions, have been separated and reunited.  Another friend said the couple have had several quarrels before and things were almost back to normal only for the fatal confrontation to ensue.  Hamisi is described as a good singer, jovial and a man who liked joking a lot with his friends.  Likoni sub-county police commander Mr Joseph Karanja confirmed the incident and said the woman will be arraigned in court today. She was held at the Inuka police station yesterday.  Mohamed’s father Hamad Hamis revealed he did know his son’s lover.  “I did not know that my son had such a lover until the incident happened,” he said.  A friend who usually hangs out with the deceased said he rushed him to a hospital before he succumbed to the injuries.  The friend, who sought anonymity said that when he arrived at the hospital, he found Hamisi still not admitted while the lover was in panic mode.  Mohamed will be buried at his rural home in Kikoneni, Kwale County.  By Phillip Mwakio | 13 hours ago By Julius Chepkwony | 1 day ago By Patrick Beja | 2 days ago By Marion Kithi | 2 days ago
