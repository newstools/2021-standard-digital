[Courtesy]  Nigerian self-styled ‘King of Satan’ and polygamist Chief Simon Odo has been buried in a car in his native Aji village, Enugu State, according to his wishes.  Chief Odo, who in 2020 claimed to have inherited the practice of satan worship from his parents and grandparents, died on December 14 aged 74 after a short illness, reports the BBC.  According to his son Uchenna Odo, the priest - said to have had 57 wives and ‘countless’ children and grandchildren - requested to be buried in a car.  Simon Odo.

The vehicle signified his transition to the underworld and journey to the afterlife, added the BBC.  Opening up about why the popular native doctor was buried quickly, one of his sons Emeka Odo said the priest left instructions about his burial preferences demanding that his body should not be taken to the morgue.  “He has been down with illness for about three weeks now. He left instruction that we should not take him to the mortuary,” Emeka told local press.
