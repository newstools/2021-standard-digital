Tharaka Nithi Governor Muthomi Njuki. [Phares Mutembei, Standard]  Tharaka Nithi Governor Muthomi Njuki has said his good working relationship with MCAs has led to a successful four years as county boss.  In his State of the County address delivered at Kathwana Stadium, Njuki heaped praise on Ward representatives who he said had accorded his administration all the support it needed to succeed.  He said the good relationship between the executive and legislature had created a conducive working environment and enhanced accountability in the various county departments.  Njuki opted to stage the event in a dome tent at the stadium to host a larger crowd. “This House has been at the centre of the development revolution that we initiated in this county, through passing various legislation that have steered implementation of transformational programs and projects,” he said.  Even as he listed various milestones he had achieved in agriculture, Njuki said in the last four years his administration had done massive investment in the construction of roads and related infrastructures like bridges and drainage.  The governor said he had identified key roads which they were upgrading to bitumen standards, including Kambandi-Cheere-Ruguti and Mitheru-Kaanwa roads.  Others are Tunyai-Nthaara, Kangoro-Kithioroni and Mitheru-Kaanwa roads.  “Road infrastructure is an important enabler of economic and social development in our county since it helps facilitate movement of people and goods,” he told the gathering.  At the same time, Njuki said he had identified the improvement of infrastructure in trading centers as a key economic project.  He said through the value chain approach, they had been able to increase production across the various sectors in the four years.
