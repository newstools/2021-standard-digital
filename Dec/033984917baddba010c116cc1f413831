Farmers are being trained on planting grass seedlings by an agriculture extension officer in Tana Delta. [Caroline Chebet, Standard]  Conservationists have regretted the negative effects of the suppressed rains on environmental restoration efforts targeted at combating climate change.  This follows a recent warning by Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FewsNet) that Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia and Uganda will experience below-average rains, a situation likely to intensify food insecurity through at least mid-2022.  “The impact on the failure of rains has been dire. Livestock carcasses are strewn all over. In areas where pastoralism is a major source of livelihoods, like in the Tana River, people are felling trees so that the livestock can feed on leaves. Many have lost hundreds of livestock,” said Hassan Golo, a resident of Tana River. FewsNet estimates that up to 20 million people in Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya and Uganda will need food relief through mid-2022. It blamed the situation on drought, insecurity, and economic challenges. While the drought has continued to impact livelihoods, felling trees for livestock to feed on the branches has become the norm, a challenge that conservationists say has impacted conservation efforts. “The suppressed rains have affected tree growing initiatives in several parts of the country too. This will impact on the long term efforts to achieve forest cover,” said David Keter, director for Greenlife and Nature organisation.  Nature Kenya director Paul Matiku said the suppressed rains are already affecting restoration initiatives across the country. “This has also intensified cases of seawater intrusion in Coastal areas because the water levels in River Tana is not enough to push back seawater,” said Matiku.     By Winfrey Owino | 39 minutes ago By James Omoro | 3 hours ago By Robert Abong'o and Winfrey Owino | 5 hours ago By Judah Ben-Hur | 8 hours ago
