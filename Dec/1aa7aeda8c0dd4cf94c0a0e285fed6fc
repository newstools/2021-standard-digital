Taita-Taveta Governor Granton Samboja. [David Njaaga, Standard]  It was a Christmas gift for 154 Taita-Taveta County staff after the Public Service Board elevated those whose contracts had expired to permanent and pensionable terms.  The details were given by Governor Granton Samboja when he addressed county staff yesterday.  He urged them to be committed to their work, adding that more workers will be hired and promoted to deliver quality services to the public.  “We are committed towards growth and diversification of the county staff to ensure efficiency and delivery of quality services,” Mr Samboja said. Board chairman Alfred Mlolwa said those who have benefited are staff from the Department of Finance and Planning, Environment and Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries. The county has more than 3,000 workers.  “As much as many people are reading politics in the promotions, this move is in the right direction because it is expensive to retain staff on contract,” he said.  “The contracts expired this month. Extending them would have been expensive as it attracts gratuity at the end. Instead of renewing their contracts or extending it, we have decided to appoint them on permanent and pensionable terms,” stated Mr Mlolwa.  Meanwhile, all roads lead to Malela Primary School in Werugha Location as the governor hosts a Christmas Eve party today for the residents.       By Hezron Kimari and Jael Mboga | 21 hours ago By Renson Mnyamwezi | 1 day ago By Philip Mwakio | 1 day ago By Willis Oketch | 3 days ago
