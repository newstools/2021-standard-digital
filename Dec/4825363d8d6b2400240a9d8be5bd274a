Police have arrested 11 students of Naivasha Boys Secondary School, following a fire that destroyed property worth millions of shillings.  The boys were arrested hours after a dormitory and personal effects of over 60 students were destroyed in a fire that broke out last night.  The dormitory in the private school located in Maryland Estate caught fire at around 8pm when the students were in class for their evening studies.  Jared Kuria, who lives near the school, said lack of water and strong winds affected efforts to contain the fire or rescue students’ personal effects.  Headteachers: Postpone exams and close earlier  Fred Matiang'i blames rights activists for school fires  Maranda High School dormitory on fire again  Parents to know fate in Sh21 million school fire case Naivasha Deputy County Commissioner Mutua Kisilu said no one was injured and initial investigations pointed to arson.  “Police have taken over the issue,” he said.
