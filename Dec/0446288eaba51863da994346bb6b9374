Susan Nyambura. [Harun Wathari, Standard]  A 74-year-old woman seeking a share of Sh100 million worth of property left behind by a German tycoon has presented new witnesses.  Susan Nyambura has listed Gideon Mwangi and Peter Munga as witnesses after the death of her two siblings, Francis Waweru and Lucy Wairimu.  Mwangi is her brother-in-law and Munga is a close friend. Nyambura said the two were aware of her marriage to the late Joseph Leitmann.  Waweru and Wairimu died on September 17 and 23, respectively, forcing Nyambura to bring in the two as witnesses in the succession case. According to Nyambura’s lawyer Owino Oenga, the two will shed light on Nyambura’s dowry payment ceremony and her stay with the late tycoon.  Oenga filed his proposal on December 15, 2021, before Justice Hillary Chemitei, saying the deaths had affected the case hence the need for him to seek a replacement.  Nyambura is battling her niece, Lucy Wanjiku, 52, over the inheritance of Leitmann, who died on August 3, 2001, intestate. Wanjiku insists she was Leitmann’s sole wife and wants her aunt locked out of the estate, but Nyambura claims she was also married to Leitmann and wants a share of the estate.  The case will be heard on February 9 and 10, next year.   By Betty Njeru | 11 hours ago By Jael Mboga | 1 day ago By Rosa Agutu | 3 days ago By Mireri Junior | 4 days ago Enjoy unlimited access to The Standard website at a 50% discount on the yearly plan.
