The body was found floating in a borehole at Kona Shopping Centre. [Courtesy]  Police in Transmara are investigating an incident where a body of a 39-year-old primary school teacher was found in a borehole.  According to area sub-County Police Commander Pius Mbithi, the teacher, who is said to have been engaged in a domestic squabble with his wife, left a suicide note.  "The deceased left a note at his desk at the school indicating the contacts of his wife and where his body would be found,” said Mbithi.  The police boss said the residents found the body floating in a borehole at Kona Shopping Centre on Wednesday. The deceased is reported to have left his rental premises within the trading centre early yesterday morning.  "At around 9 am, some passers-by saw a coat, shoes and a mobile phone next to the borehole," he said.  Upon peeping into the borehole, they saw the body and alerted the authorities.  Police moved the body to the Kegonga mortuary in neighbouring Kisii County.  The incident happened barely two days after another teacher was found dead in Narok North.  According to area sub-County Police Commander Frederick Shiundu, the body of George Timisek, 34, was found dangling from a tree.  The police boss said the deceased was a deputy headteacher at Lengesurai primary school.   By Marion Kithi | 3 hours ago By Nancy Nzau | 4 hours ago By Jane Mugambi | 5 hours ago By Isaiah Gwengi | 5 hours ago
