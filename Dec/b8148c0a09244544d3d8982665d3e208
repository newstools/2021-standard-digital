Tharaka Nithi Governor Muthomi Njuki joins people living with disabilities at Kathwana in Tharaka Nithi on Friday. [Phares Mutembei, Standard]  The county government is making its own special identification cards for people living with disabilities, Governor Muthomi Njuki has said.  Speaking at Kathwana town during the International Day of Persons with Disabilities on Friday, Mr Njuki said the special cards will ensure the disabled can access services they need to improve their lives.  “We will use the available technology to identify people living with disability. The special card will be used in Tharaka Nithi,” said Njuki.  According to the governor, disabled people continue to suffer for lack of an effective identification tool, hence his decision to start a new registration programme.  Sports can change lives of people living with disabilities  Painful tales of raising special needs children  Kenya bounce back to thrash Libya after slow start to Online Chess Olympiad games  Kenya upbeat ahead of Online Chess Olympiad for People with Disability   He further dismissed the national government’s registration programme, saying that fraudsters were hacking it and making fake identification cards for the vulnerable group, therefore denying bona fide members important services.  Njuki said persons with disability should not pay taxes in markets, adding that with the special identification card, they will also be able to access services at health facilities without paying consultation fees.
