A man has been slapped with a life sentence for defilement.  Hilary Zitendi was found guilty of defiling a minor, aged one-and-a-half years, on June 24, 2018 in Kakamega.  Zitendi was found guilty of defilement and an alternative count of committing an indecent act on a minor contrary to the Sexual Offences Act. Court documents indicated SM (not her real name) who is the mother of the baby girl, left her at home with a guardian as she left to attend a meeting in a neighbouring home.  While at the meeting, she heard noise coming from her home, prompting her to rush back to know what had happened. She found the baby in pain, with blood all over.    The mother reported the matter to the nearby police station. Police arrested the accused on the same day.  She took the baby to hospital.  “He will serve a life sentence for the offense committed which is contrary to section 8(2) of the Sexual Offense Act and an alternative count of committing an indecent act on a minor contrary to section 11(1) of the Sexual Offense Act,” ruled Kakamega Senior Resident Magistrate Erick Malesi.     By Brian Kisanji | 6 hours ago By Alexander Chagema | 6 hours ago By Benard Lusigi | 6 hours ago By Brian Kisanji | 6 hours ago Enjoy unlimited access to The Standard website at a 50% discount on the yearly plan.
