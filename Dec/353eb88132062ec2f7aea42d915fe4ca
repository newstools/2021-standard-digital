A voter casts her ballot in the Kiagu Ward by-election in Meru County. [Phares Mutembei, Standard]  Morning rains in Central Imenti Sub County in Meru County have hampered some voters from casting ballots early in the ongoing Kiagu ward by-election.  Though Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) official Francis Wanderi and County Election Manager Macharia Gichichi were out early to oversee the exercise, only a few voters were at select stations.  Polling stations were open by 6 am but officials had little to do on top of waiting for voters to come out.  The stations are mainly located in schools. However, Mr Wanderi expressed optimism that the numbers would pick up as the rain dissipated.  "It (exercise) has taken off smoothly but due to downpour in the morning but we expect more people as rains subside," said Wanderi.  Stephen Kimuntiro, a voter, turned up early at Makandune Secondary School to cast his ballot. "Despite the rain, I left my chores to come vote before queues become long, he said.  Jubilee’s Samson Magambo is facing off with United Democratic Alliance (UDA’s) Simon Kiambi and Patrick Kathurima of Chama cha Uzalendo.
