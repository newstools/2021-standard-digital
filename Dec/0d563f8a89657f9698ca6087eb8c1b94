Dr. Robert Pukose, MP Endebess [Andrew Kilonzi, Standard]  Police are investigating how a vehicle belonging to Endebbes MP Dr Robert Pukose burst into flames yesterday.  The double cabin pick up truck was reduced to a shell just a few metres from the legislator’s home in the constituency.  Amos Maramgach, the MP's driver and guard, had parked the vehicle about 100 metres from the MP's compound and rushed back to collect something he had forgotten in the house.  Marangach said his wife, who had woken up to milk the cows, was the first to see flames and notified him.  Why Endebess MP Robert Pukose juggles surgery and politics  MPs want seed and fertilizer prices lowered  Local Jubilee leaders back Pukose as Committee ouster debate rages  MPs Moses Kuria, Ichungwa could be next on Jubilee’s chopping board Efforts to get neighbours to help put out the fire that started at around 5am were fruitless.       Pro-Ruto MP Pukose asks President Uhuru Kenyatta to respect the Constitution and retire after 2022  KTN Prime: Circus at Afya House as signatures to oust Nyamai go missing By Lynn Kolongei | 2 hours ago By Patrick Beja | 2 hours ago By Hudson Gumbihi | 2 hours ago By Pkemoi Ng'enoh | 2 hours ago
