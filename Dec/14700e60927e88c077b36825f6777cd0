The government has released Sh1.2 billion to support some 360,696 households in drought-hit counties.  The government has also shifted from food distribution to cash transfers, according to Cabinet Secretary (CS) for Special Programmes, Professor Margaret Kobia.  “The first cohort of households in the Emergency Relief Cash Transfer programme will get Sh3,000 per family on a monthly basis until the situation improves,” said Kobia.   The CS was speaking during the launch of the Emergency Relief Cash Transfer programme in Nairobi on Thursday. Already, beneficiaries have been identified in 23 arid and semi-arid counties.   The CS also announced plans by the government to buy from farmers 76,667 livestock that are considered weak and that will be slaughtered for distribution as relief food.  The Ground Slaughter Programme is a joint initiative bringing together the ministry of Public Service, the ministry of Defense, the Kenya Meat Commission and the Kenya Red Cross Society.  The CS said benefiting households are those with vulnerable persons who are not receiving any other assistance.    By Martin Ndiema | 3 hours ago By Andrew Kipkemboi  | 3 hours ago By Roselyne Obala | 3 hours ago By Mireri Junior | 10 hours ago
