A 12-year-old boy died by suicide in Sirende village, Trans Nzoia County, after he allegedly differed with his father.  The grade four pupil at Sirende primary school reportedly took his life by hanging at a neighbour's coffee plantation.  The minor had been assigned some work at home by his father, which he declined to do.  After quarrelling with his father, he left home to an unknown place, and his disappearance prompted the family members to mount a search.  Profile of Benson Imbatu, the policeman who killed 6 in Kabete  Kabete 6 shooting: Horror scenes in dead of night as love affair ends tragically  Officer shoots dead six people including girlfriend, kills self in Kangemi  Kitale health centre to get Sh185m upgrade They later found the pupil hanging from a branch of a coffee tree the next day. The deceased has been living with his stepmother.  His mother and father separated some time back over family issues.

"The boy accused his stepmother of mistreating him," said a neighbour.  Kiminini OCPD Joseph Tumbo said the body was removed to Kitale county hospital mortuary.  "Unfortunately, the minor ended his life over family issues," he said.  The officer urged parents to have a dialogue with their children when there is an issue in the family.
