Rose Angelina pleaded with the judge to release her on bond. [Courtesy]  A middle-aged woman shocked an Eldoret court when she confessed to killing her 10-month-old infant.  The woman claimed that she killed the sick infant because she lacked the money to take him to the hospital.  The murder suspect, Rose Angelina, claimed that she committed the heinous act after the father of his son abandoned his parental responsibility, leaving her to bear the burden of upkeep.  “Your honour, I caused my son's death and then buried him in a shallow grave,” said Angelina when she appeared before Justice Eric Ogola. The accused person, a casual labourer, is said to have strangled her son to death on January 12, 2017, at Chikuli village in Kakamega County.  Angelina pleaded with the judge to release her on bond, saying that she had stayed in Eldoret GK remand prison since police arrested her in 2017.  She told the judge that none of her close family members had ever visited her in prison since the arrest.  “I pray that you release me on bond because I am suffering,” she told the judge.  When asked by the judge where she intends to go if released on bond now that none of her relatives wants to be associated with her, Angelina said she would travel to her uncle's place in Kitale since they are on good terms.  Justice Ogola said he will make a ruling on her bail application on May 11, 2022. He directed that the accused be escorted back to Eldoret GK women prison.
