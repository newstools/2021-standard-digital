Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu during a meeting at the Women’s Association Hall, Mombasa. [Paul Mutua, Standard]  The National Rainbow Coalition (Narc) will field candidates for elective posts across the country in next year’s elections.  Narc leader Charity Ngilu, however, said the party will support Azimio La Umoja Movement and ODM leader Raila Odinga’s presidential bid.  She was speaking at the Mombasa Women’s Association Hall on Sunday evening after chairing a Kamba consultative meeting. “The party will work with like-minded political parties to form the next government after the 2022 polls,” she said.  Ngilu urged Raila to take the Azimio La Umoja Movement campaigns across the country, saying it was the right direction for the country to take as it goes into elections.   “The movement will form the next government in 2022. There is need to take the campaign to every corner of the country.”  She dismissed One Kenya Alliance’s ability to marshal votes and win the presidential election on its own.  Ngilu said the presidential election was a two-horse race between Raila and Deputy President William Ruto of the United Democratic Alliance.
