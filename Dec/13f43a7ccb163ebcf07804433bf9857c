Kanu Secretary-general Nick Salat at Njoro town in Nakuru on February 12, 2021. [Kipsang Joseph,Standard].  Kanu chairman Gideon Moi has sent a message of condolence to the family of party secretary-general Nick Salat.  Mama Elizabeth Salat is said to have been a strong pillar in the family and society at large.  “She was a champion of social justice and an advocate of women empowerment as well as girls’ education at a time when gender equality was frowned upon,” Gideon said.  Elizabeth held various leadership positions, including being a nominated councilor, head of Maendeleo ya Wanawake in Kericho and a church leader. The Baringo senator went on, “Our relationship as the families of the late President Daniel Moi and the late Hon. Isaac Salat goes back to the period when the entire Kipsigis nation was one district of Kericho.  “It is through these deep historical family ties, where Mama Elizabeth played a key role alongside many others, that Mzee built a strong political support base in the then Rift Valley province."  Gideon said the death of Mama Elizabeth is a big blow not only to their families but also to the entire nation.   "We stand in solidarity with Hon. Nick Salat and the family and assure them of our support throughout this period. They are in our thoughts and prayers during this difficult time of mourning."
