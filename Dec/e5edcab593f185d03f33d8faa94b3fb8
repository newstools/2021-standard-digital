A CZ pistol and 40 rounds of ammunition were recovered from the police officer. [Courtesy]  A police constable attached to Police Headquarters in Nairobi has been arrested on suspicion of attempting to sell a firearm loaded with 15 rounds of ammunition.  In a report filed at the Naivasha Police Station under the OB Number 3/28/12/2021, the police constable had plotted to meet a proxy, who would allegedly help him sell the pistol.  The trade was to take place at the Craft Yard Club in Naivasha, Nakuru County.  However, his would-be proxy had already alerted police of the planned sale. An ambush was consequently laid. “The police officer arrived at the Craft Yard Club [on Monday night]. He was aboard a grey Nissan Note taxi, which was being driven by a 38-year-old man, a resident of Ruiru, Kiambu County. Also in the car, was a 30-year-old woman, a resident of Ruaka, Kiambu County,” said the police report filed 30 minutes past midnight.  Police recovered a CZ pistol of serial number KE-KP F1948 loaded with 15 rounds of 9mm ammunition. Also recovered were 25 other rounds of ammunition, a National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) card, two Samsung phones and a Redmi smartphone.  The three suspects were arrested and taken to Naivasha Police Station, where they are being held as investigations continue.
