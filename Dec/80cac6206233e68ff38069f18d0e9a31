West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo. [Courtesy]  Governor John Lonyangapuo has faulted Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa) for delays in supplying drugs and other medical supplies to health facilities.  Lonyangapuo, who spoke while opening municipal council kiosks in Makutano town, criticised the government’s policy requiring counties to source medical supplies from one agency.  “Counties are suffering because of the delays by Kemsa. Drugs requisition takes up to three to four months. Health is one of the big four agenda and cannot be achieved when entities such as Kemsa deny our country the essential supplies needed,” Lonyangapuo said.  He added, “We might opt to get supplies from other bodies as we cannot sit and watch people suffer.”   He added that several health facilities had no drugs as they wait for the long procurement processes and clearance at Kemsa.     By Winfrey Owino | 39 minutes ago By James Omoro | 3 hours ago By Robert Abong'o and Winfrey Owino | 5 hours ago By Judah Ben-Hur | 8 hours ago
