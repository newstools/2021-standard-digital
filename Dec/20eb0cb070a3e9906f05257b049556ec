Deputy President William Ruto has urged Kenyans to elect the next president based on their track record, not political rhetoric.  In his vote hunt in Tana River County yesterday, Dr Ruto claimed his competitors had served in top leadership positions.   “This is a contest for experience and capacity to transform the country, not a beauty contest. Those I am competing with held top positions in this country and must show Kenyans what they achieved,” Ruto said.  He said ODM leader Raila Odinga, served as Prime Minister; while Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and Amani National Congress’ Musalia Mudavadi had been Vice-presidents, and must show their track records.   “In my time as deputy president, the number of people connected to electricity in Tana River rose from 23,000 to 92,000 and three technical training colleges were built. We supplied Hola Hospital with modern medical equipment worth Sh400 million,” Ruto said, adding: “I believe my track record has been exemplary compared to those I am competing with.”  Ruto courted Tana River residents, promising to heavily fund agriculture, livestock and water sectors, and make the area Kenya’s food basket.  At Garsen market, Ruto claimed Raila was still pushing for constitutional reforms to create political positions and get a chance to shortchange certain communities. He vowed to change the economic model and create jobs at the grassroots level instead of dwelling on constitutional change.
