David Kipruto Kwambai allegedly shot and wounded his girlfriend. [Courtesy]  Kenya Forest Service (KFS) warder who allegedly shot and wounded his girlfriend has denied charges of attempted murder before an Eldoret Court.  David Kipruto Kwambai denied the charges before Senior Resident Magistrate Emily Kigen.  Kwambai allegedly attempted to cause the death of Charity Kiplagat by shooting her using a government gun on November 29 at Strawburg in Kongasis village in Ainabkoi sub-County within Uasin Gishu County.  He was released on a Sh300,000 bond. Investigating officer Isaac Kosgei had earlier told the court that the accused, a forest warder based at KFS camp in Loliondo, Narok County, had gone missing before his arrest.  He said the officer had his official firearm, which had 28 rounds of ammunition when he left his work station and travelled to Uasin Gishu to attack his girlfriend.  The officer shot Ms Kiplagat at her house.  "The bullet entered through the stomach and exited through the pelvic bone," he said.  The victim is admitted to a hospital in Eldoret.  Kosgei told the court that the suspect went into hiding but was arrested in Narok County after four days.  The case will be heard on January 13, 2021.   By Kennedy Gachuhi | 6 hours ago By Bakari Ang'ela | 11 hours ago By Mireri Junior | 12 hours ago By Antony Gitonga | 20 hours ago
