At least eight people including two minors were rescued from the debris of a building that collapsed in Miti Moja Tuwan estate, Kitale town in Trans Nzoia County yesterday afternoon.  The building, a maize store that was filled with over 3,000 bags of dry maize, fell on the nearby mud-walled structures used as rental premises.  The victims were rushed to Kitale Level Four Hospital.  County Commissioner Sam Ojwang’ who toured the scene confirmed that the eight victims were treated for minor injuries and discharged.  Ojwang’ also directed that the bags of maize be removed from the store in search of other casualties citing that the number of occupants in the affected housing units could not be immediately ascertained. "I have directed the National Construction Authority, the County department of Public Works and other responsible agencies to investigate and establish if there was any negligence in the construction of the building," stated Ojwang’.  Pointing out that action would be taken against the premise owner and those involved in the construction should the probe find them guilty, Ojwang’ cautioned traders against contravening set procedures while putting up premises for their businesses.  On her part, the owner of the store, Annah Wanjiku claimed that tremor as a result of the heavy road construction machinery on the Kitale - Suam road had caused cracks and weak joints on the wall of the store and that was the cause of the collapse.
