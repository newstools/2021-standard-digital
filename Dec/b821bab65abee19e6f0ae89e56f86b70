Police reservist at one of the houses set ablaze by suspected bandits at Ol Moran, Laikipia. September 10, 2021. [Kipsang Joseph, Standard]  A man was injured on Saturday night in an attack by suspected bandits at Ol Moran area in Laikipia West.  John Njuguna was alone in his house when the bandits struck.  Sossian ward MCA Jacob Edung said Njuguna was shot on his hand and buttocks.  "The attackers left without stealing anything from him. They shot several times in the air to scare away residents, leaving him lying in a pool of blood," he said. The MCA said they rushed him to Ol Moran health centre for first aid, before moving him to Nyahururu County hospital.  "He was later referred to Kenyatta National Hospital to get specialised treatment," said Edung.  Kirima Sub-County Deputy County commissioner John Orata, who confirmed the incident, said that police are hunting for the attackers.  "They attacked him at around 9 pm. We are currently pursuing the attackers who fled towards Baringo. We have also deployed more police along the border," he said.  Laikipia Nature and Conservancy ranch management have raised alarm over the rising cases of wildlife being killed by illegal grazers.  Yesterday morning, two elephants were found dead with their tusks hacked off inside the ranch.  "Illegal grazers have now turned their anger on the innocent animals. The government should beef up security efforts and eject them from the ranch," said the ranch's director, Ms Svyeva Gallman.   By Philip Mwakio | 3 hours ago By Bakari Ang'ela | 3 hours ago By Lynn Kolongei | 15 hours ago By Obare Osinde | 1 day ago Enjoy unlimited access to The Standard website at a 50% discount on the yearly plan.
