Moi County Referral Hospital Medical Superintendent Felix Kimotho said they received four bodies and treated 36 patients.

The accident comes two days after the Anglican Church of Kenya Taita-Taveta Diocese, police and Boda boda operators conducted prayers at Ndii along the Nairobi-Mombasa and in Mwatate junction along the Voi-Taveta highways.  ACK Diocese Bishop Liverson Mng’onda led the interdenominational prayers along the two busy highways.  Police and religious leaders have cautioned motorists against speeding during the festive season.  The bishop said the prayers were meant to bring sanity on the roads, which he said had registered numerous accidents and loss of lives.  “We need you to be alive so that you can continue feeding your families and paying taxes to the government,” said a senior police officer at the prayer service.     By Philip Mwakio | 2 hours ago By Willis Oketch | 2 days ago By Renson Mnyamwezi | 2 days ago By Renson Mnyamwezi | 2 days ago Enjoy unlimited access to The Standard website at a 50% discount on the yearly plan.
