[Harun Wathari, Standard]  A 21-year-old man is to spend the remaining days of his life in prison for defiling his step-daughter.  The magistrate's court sitting in Molo sentenced Victor Mogi Achuti after he was found guilty of defiling the six-year-old girl last year.  Mogi was accused of committing the offence on December 16, 2020, after the girl was left under his care by his wife.  During the proceedings, Mogi maintained innocence, but Molo Resident Magistrate Emmanuel Soita said that witness statements and other evidence adduced in court showed that he committed the offence. Victor Mogi Achuti has 14 days to appeal the ruling?.

The court directed that the convict serves his term at the Nakuru GK Prison, saying that the sentence will deter other would-be offenders from committing such offence.
