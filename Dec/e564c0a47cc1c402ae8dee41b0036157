Ndhiwa sub-county police commander Paul Rioba said the driver will appear in court as soon as they are done with their investigations.  “We are still investigating the matter. He will be arraigned soon,” Rioba said.  “The young man boarded the tractor but there was no space for him to sit. It is better to board a motorbike instead of boarding a motor vehicle that has no space,” Rioba said.  The body was taken to Manyatta Kobodo mortuary.
