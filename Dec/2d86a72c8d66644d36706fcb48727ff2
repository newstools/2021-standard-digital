ODM chief Raila Odinga is expected to announce his candidature in the 2022 presidential polls.  Previously described by his adversaries as an “aggressive, confrontational, adversarial and rabble-rousing” politician, Raila has morphed into a more collaborative leader, attracting the favour of wealthy Mt. Kenya businessmen, some of whom were uncomfortable in his leadership.  Raila, the African Union special envoy for Infrastructure currently enjoys support from President Uhuru Kenyatta, who said in a public rally that age occasions wisdom.  Raila will be 77 years old next year when he’ll be taking a fifth stab at the presidency.
