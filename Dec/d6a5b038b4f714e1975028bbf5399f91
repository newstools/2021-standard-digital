Bungoma Police Commander Mutungi Musyoki told The Standard that Wanjala’s family was free to collect the body from Bungoma County Referral Hospital mortuary.  “We are not interested in the body anymore. The family should have picked it for burial immediately after autopsy,” said Musyoki.   Robert Watila, Wanjala’s father, has insisted that the police refused to produce the body.  Watila, 55, said he had never set eyes on his son’s body since lynching by a mob at Mukhweya in Bungoma County on October 15.  “I would like to have his body so I can bury it as per our culture, but the police appear noncommittal,” said Mr Watila.  He said two days after his son was killed, police forced him to sign forms at his home.  “By signing the forms, the officers said I was confirming that Masten was murdered and I witnessed the postmortem. How can one confirm what he or she has not seen,” he posed.  Police say Watila witnessed the postmortem.  Watila says bad luck may befall his clan if he is not allowed to bury his son as per the traditions.
