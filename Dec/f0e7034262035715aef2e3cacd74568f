Residents at River Olando where the eggs were dumped. [James Omoro, Standard]  Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) officials are on the spot after thousands of rotten eggs were found dumped in rivers Olando and Koga in Homa Bay.  Homa Bay DCI officer Abed Kavoo said the eggs had been taken from the Homa Bay Police Station and handed to KRA officials in Mbita.  “We released the eggs a month ago to KRA. We are yet to know who and how the eggs were discarded in the river,” Kavoo said.  The 7,800 crates of eggs worth Sh2.7 million were confiscated while being transported in a lorry at Rodi Kopany market in late October. Police claimed the lorry owner had evaded tax.  Mining company denies illegal blasting claims  Rude shock for police officers suspected of torture  Homa Bay residents to start benefiting from Sh452.8m markets  Kaluma: No slay queen hurt me, new law therefore isn’t revenge Josiah Nyandoro, Homa Bay County Director of the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA), said they had taken water samples from the two rivers to the government chemist for analysis.      Woman in Homa Bay loses hand in domestic violence over suspicion of dating another man  Kiswahili cha kipekee cha Gavana wa Homa Bay, Cyprian Awiti | MIRINDIMI  Homa Bay County Government comes to the rescue of displaced Karachuonyo flood victims By Harold Odhiambo and Isaiah Gwengi | 13 hours ago By James Omoro | 1 day ago By James Omoro | 1 day ago By Kevin Oguttu | 1 day ago
