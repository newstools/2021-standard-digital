President Uhuru Kenyatta today at State House, Nairobi, assented to the Central Bank of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, Public Private Partnership Bill, and Trustees (Perpetual Succession) (Amendment) Act, all of 2021.  The amended Central Bank Act, 2021, gives the Central Bank of Kenya powers to license digital lenders in the country as well as ensure the existence of fair and non-discriminatory practices in the credit market.  On its part, the new Public Private Partnerships Act repeals the 2013 legislation by providing an elaborate legal framework to cover both national and county level PPP projects.
