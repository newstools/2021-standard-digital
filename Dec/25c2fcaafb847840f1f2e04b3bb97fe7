Mahoo Ward seat fell vacant following the death of the former MCA Ronald Sagurani. [Benard Sanga, Standard]  Two agents from Jubilee and United Democratic Alliance (UDA) were yesterday arrested for causing chaos at a voting centre in Taveta sub-county.  The agents fought at Mahoo Primary School polling station temporarily disrupting the election exercise.  Meanwhile, claims of voter bribery, intimidation, and threats marred the voting exercise in the Mahoo Ward by-election which started at around 6am.   There was a heavy presence of police officers in the 14 polling stations where 5,734 registered voters were expected to cast their vote for their new MCA.  Jubilee's Donald Fundi Saleri, UDA's Daniel Kimuyu and Tujibebe Wakenya candidate Samuel Obuoge are battling for the seat.  The seat fell vacant following the death of the former MCA Ronald Sagurani in August this year.   On Thursday morning, former Governor John Mruttu, who supports the UDA candidate, stormed the IEBC tallying centre to protest alleged voter bribery.  Mruttu claimed voters at Mahoo polling station were being threatened by an armed gang that had been deployed to cause fear among the party supporters.  However, Taveta Sub County Police Commander Giffinalis Baraza denied claims of bribery and intimidation.   "No such incidences have been reported in the area. I have gone round in all the polling stations and so far there were no fracas reported," he said.  IEBC County Elections Manager Swalhah Ibrahim Yusuf also denied the bribery allegations.     By Biketi Kikechi | 3 hours ago By Benard Sanga and Stanley Mwahanga | 3 hours ago By Brian Kisanji | 3 hours ago By Jacinta Mutura | 3 hours ago
