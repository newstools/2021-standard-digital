After years of construction, the hospital is now open to the public. [Courtesy, NMS]  The Nairobi Metropolitan Services has renamed Mathare-Korogocho Level 5 Hospital to Mama Margaret Kenyatta Hospital.  The Sh400 million refurbished hospital located in Mathare North, that opened its doors to patients yesterday, is the biggest hospital in terms of bed capacity under the management of Nairobi County Government. The hospital has a 359-bed capacity.  The five-storey facility, whose construction had stalled, until last year when NMS was tasked with reviving it, will be the first county referral hospital under the management of the county government.  The hospital, that has a floor dedicated to attend to boda boda injuries, also aims to reduce the patient load at Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital, also a Level 5 facility. The hospital being named after Margaret Kenyatta, comes ten years after Embakasi District Hospital was renamed to Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital, Kenya’s third First Lady.  Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital was built to help decongest the Kenyatta National Hospital.
