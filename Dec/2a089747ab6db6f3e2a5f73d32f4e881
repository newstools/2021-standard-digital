A suspected peddler and ex-convict in Lamu yesterday plunged into the sea to evade arrest.  The man was also carrying a panga when he resisted arrest and took the plunge, police reported.  Two officers who grew up along the banks of River Nzoia, dived into the sea to arrest the man.  What followed was a dramatic chase in the sea, as the suspected peddler swum towards the deep sea to evade arrest. Meanwhile, the officers battled the current closely behind.  In a scene that lasted about 30 minutes, the suspect would occasionally disappear under the water only to reappear floating at different points.  A marine boat that was on patrol arrived on time with more officers, who also took the plunge.  The suspect was arrested, and while he was being escorted along the sea front, one Ali Mohammad  attempted to obstruct the officers while another one identified as Famau Muhashe, threw a projectile at the officers, seriously injuring constable Leonard Mutai.  All the three suspects are currently in police custody.
