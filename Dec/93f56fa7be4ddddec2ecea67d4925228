[Courtesy]  Maragua Member of Parliament Mary Wamaua claims she was blocked from entering Kasarani Stadium on Friday, December 10, during Raila Odinga’s Azimio la Umoja convention.  Wamaua said her VIP invitation card did not help her to get access to the event.  The lawmaker alleges that she was roughed up by “goons”. According to her, non-professional security officers were manning the entrances, and that they appeared to have not received training on how to separate valid VIP guests, from wannabes.  “My bodyguards’ intervention efforts were frustrated by the goons,” she told The Standard.  “I was bundled out of the venue like a sack of potatoes. As a result, I got annoyed and left the stadium,” said Wamaua.  The altercation was caught on video, which went viral on social media.  “It’s very unfortunate that Azimio la Umoja, an event founded on peace and unity, had elements of roughness and disorder,” she said, adding: “I am urging Raila Odinga to rein in on that errant group.”  Last month, the Maragua MP ditched Jubilee Party for Deputy President William Ruto-linked party, the United Democratic Alliance (UDA).  She said she was attending Odinga’s event “out of respect for President Uhuru Kenyatta, and the need to show her commitment to the quest for national unity”.  Odinga is expected to announce his candidature in the 2022 presidential election, a seat that DP Ruto is also eyeing.  At least 21 governors, more than 60 MPs and senators attended the function, which was beamed live on several national television stations.
