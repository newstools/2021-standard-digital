A 37-year-old woman died on Sunday night at Kithima village in Gichugu, Kirinyaga County after she was reportedly hacked by a panga in a domestic row.   According to witnesses Charity Wangui and his 47-year-old husband, James Muchiri fought over a new mobile phone the former had acquired secretly.  The couple is reported to have fought with the husband reportedly setting their house ablaze with the deceased inside after she failed to disclose the source of her new phone.  “The feud started when Muchiri inquired to know where the wife had gotten a phone which was allegedly given to her by another man,” said a witness. Gichugu Sub-County DCI boss Millicent Ochuka confirmed the incident.  Ochuka said Wangui’s hands were chopped off using a panga.  She said investigations have been launched while the deceased's body was moved to Kerugoya Hospital mortuary awaiting a postmortem.  The murder comes a few days after an assistant chief in Gichugu also died in what is believed to be a domestic row.  Last Month a mother and her four children were also hacked to death within Gichugu area.
