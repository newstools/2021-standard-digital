Police officers and local leaders at Suyan area in Samburu after an attack that left nine people dead, November 3, 2021. [Michael Saitoti, Standard]  Tension is high in Pura area of Samburu County after suspected bandits killed two people, including a police officer.  Samburu Central OCPD Alex Rotich said a police officer was shot dead while the officer in charge of Maralal Police Station was left nursing gunshot wounds following the attack which occurred on Saturday at Pura market.  Rotich said the officers were ambushed by suspected bandits when they had accompanied villagers to collect a body of a man who was shot dead a day earlier.  According to authorities, some 3,587 people have fled the village and temporarily settled at Loboingare trading centre for the past two days. “We are appealing to communities and other stakeholders to work hard to ensure calm is restored in the area before schools open next week,” said Daniel Lesaigor, chief officer in charge of disaster and special programmes.  The attackers torched several manyattas and stole livestock left behind by the fleeing villagers.  Franol Leshalote, a resident of Pura, said that five manyattas were burnt down and maize in the stores destroyed.  “The goats and calves that we left at home are all gone,” said Riana Lenailepu, a resident of Pura.  The locals are calling upon the national government to intervene and ensure peace is restored in the area so that they can go back to their homes.   “We are asking the government to deploy place officers to work from that market,” said Joseph Lesiamito, a resident.      By Antony Gitonga | 11 hours ago By Nikko Tanui | 12 hours ago By Kamore Maina | 13 hours ago By Kennedy Gachuhi | 20 hours ago
