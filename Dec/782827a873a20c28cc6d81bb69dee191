The suspect is currently being held at Nyatieko Police Station. [Courtesy]  Police in Kisii are holding a man who allegedly hacked his wife and two stepchildren with a machete, seriously injuring them, in Nyakoe on Sunday evening.  Confirming the incident, Kisii County Police Commander Francis Kooli said the suspect, Daniel Asiago, turned on his wife Ednah Kerubo and her two children following a domestic dispute.  Kooli said the three were rushed to the Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital for treatment and are under observation.  "The suspect is currently being held at Nyatieko Police Station as we continue with investigations before he is taken to court,'' said Kooli. Following the attack, irate members of the public set ablaze Asiago's house vowing not to allow him set foot in the village.  ''Members of the public decided to burn down Asiago's home since they could not understand why he savagely attacked members of his family,'' said Evans Oiko, a neighbour.  According to David Ombati, a member of the local community policing group, Kerubo was the boda boda operator's third wife whom he married recently.  Ombati claimed that Asiago hacked his second wife before abandoning her for Kerubo. His first wife allegedly fled following violence in the home.
