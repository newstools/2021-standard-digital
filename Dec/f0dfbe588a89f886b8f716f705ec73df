Businessman SK Macharia has exuded confidence that ODM leader Raila Odinga will win the 2022 presidential election.  Speaking at Bukhungu Stadium on Friday, when COTU boss Francis Atwoli hosted Odinga among other leaders, the media mogul said he “hardly makes political mistakes”, when he chooses to endorse a candidate for an elective seat.  Pledging to lead nationwide campaigns for Odinga ahead of the August 9, 2022 polls, SK Macharia said: “I rarely err when it comes to politics. I have listened to what Kenyans want in a president, and I’m sure Raila fits the bill.”  The magnate urged Luhya community to back the ODM chief, saying he has the community’s interest at heart.  “We have been with Raila all these years, and I will stand by him until the end,” said the Royal Media Services Limited owner. The event was also attended by Nominated MP Maina Kamanda, who said he had received President Uhuru Kenyatta’s blessings to grace the function.  “If you see [SK] Macharia, [Peter] Kenneth, myself and businessmen [from Mount Kenya], know that [President] Uhuru [Kenyatta] has sent us here,” said Kamanda.  The legislator said Raila was making inroads in Mount Kenya, and that it’s only a matter of time that President Kenyatta would campaign for him in the vote-rich region.  Addressing Deputy President William Ruto indirectly, Kamanda posed: “How do you call someone who has contested for the presidency four times a State project?”  “Give us a break,” he added.  “[Ruto], this is your first time [to run for president]. You have to lose twice or thrice before making a final successful stab at presidency.”  By Moses Nyamori | 1 hour ago By Nathan Ochunge | 1 hour ago By Alexander Chagema | 1 hour ago By Alexander Chagema | 1 hour ago
