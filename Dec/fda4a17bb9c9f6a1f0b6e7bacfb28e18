Judge’s gavel [Courtesy]  The Court of Appeal has upheld a 20-year sentence for a man who was found guilty of defiling, impregnating and later forcing a 15-year-old girl to procure an abortion.  According to court documents, Kunona Kinyaga, a boda boda operator, is said to have defiled the minor on diverse dates between July 1 and July 31, 2013, at Laikipia North in Laikipia County. He faced an alternative charge of committing an indecent act, which the prosecution later withdrew.  The appellate judges, Justice Daniel Musinga, Roselyn Nambuye and Sankale ole Kantai said they were satisfied that the evidence tendered by the prosecution was sufficient and that the appellant was sentenced accordingly.  “We find no merit in this appeal. It is dismissed in its entirety,” ordered the judges. During the trial at the magistrate court, the prosecution told the court that Kinyaga had asked the minor, a Standard Eight candidate, to be his girlfriend, promising to marry her once she completed her primary school education.  The court heard that Kinyaga would visit the minor at her home at night and have sex. This went on until August 2013 when the pupil got pregnant.
