[Sammy Omingo, Standard]  Work on the Kebuko-Nyangusu-Nyamache road is back on track with a new contractor tasked with completing the project by December next year.  Kenya Rural Roads Authority (KeRRA ) Director General Philemon Kandie said the government is keen on completing the 25km road launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2017.  KeRRA is currently upgrading the road in Bobasi Constituency to bitumen standards.  The project was awarded to Civicon Kenya Limited on June 5, 2017, but due to capacity challenges, it has now been assigned to M/s Shengli Engineering Construction (Group) Company Limited of Shengli Outfield.  Keboko–Nyangusu road is approximately 9km, while the Riogandu–Nyamache is 8.4 km and the Nyamache–Nyacheki is 8.2km.  Kandie said the contractor suspended works in March 2021 citing financial constraints but resumed in October 2021.  “The contractor is currently working on the Rioganda-Nyamache link. To date, 5km of tarmac has been completed from Nyamache market. The remaining 3.4km will be complete by February 2022,” he said.  The contractor will then embark on the Keboko-Nyangusu link and will be completed by December 2022.  The latest report comes after some locals claimed the contractor had not been seen on site for months. Works are going on in the other 12 projects in Kisii.  KeRRA is also upgrading to bitumen standard the 23.1 km Nyabigena-Matangamano-Nyakorere-Nyamarambe road, among others.     By Harold Odhiambo | 1 day ago By James Omoro | 2 days ago By James Omoro | 4 days ago By Patrick Vidija and James Omoro | 5 days ago
