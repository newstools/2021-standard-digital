Dennis Itumbi.  An aide of Deputy President William Ruto has been reported missing to the police.  Dennis Itumbi, a former statehouse operative was reported missing at Thindigua police post in Kiambu on Thursday afternoon.   After his exit from state house in 2020, Itumbi joined the Deputy president wing and has been playing the role of a blogger and a communication strategist.  His disappearance was reported to the police by two of his close allies and an OB report number 10/23/12/2021 was issued.  The two colleagues told the police that Itumbi was in a barbershop in Thindigua estate when he was snapped by unknown men who bundled him into a car and sped off.   It was around 3pm when this incident happened.   Efforts by family and friends to trace the missing Itumbi were futile. Journalists and friends who visited Parklands police station where he was reportedly being held were informed that the police were not holding him in the cells.
