Kisumu street party started with a bang as thousands of residents turned up.  Pomp and colour marked the event with residents defying drizzles to dance in the rain as they waited for midnight to mark the start of Christmas celebrations.  Kisumu’s skies were painted with fireworks moments after ODM leader Raila Odinga officially launched the party.  Not even the heavy rains that had threatened to interrupt the jamboree barred residents from turning out in their numbers to mark the event. Oginga Odinga street and Jomo Kenyatta Avenue were covered by a mammoth crowd. Food and drinks were served as hoteliers served party-goers.  Leaders who attended the official opening of the event described it as a wonderful opportunity for residents to share with the less fortunate.  Raila said the carnival was one of its kind and added that charitable activities should also be a priority for residents.  “The difference between human beings and animals is what they do on earth. Let us take this opportunity to give back to others,” said Raila.  During the event, a number of people who turned up for the party said it has given them an opportunity to interact with other people.  John Owino, a resident of Nyalenda, said he had to walk to town to catch a glimpse of the festival.  “We are happy. The party has given us a chance to celebrate Christmas and appreciate the development taking place in the county,” he said.  But he is not alone, David Okumu and Elphas Bungei from Manyatta slums said the event has given them an opportunity to appreciate the work of local artists.  Several artists were lined up to perform in the event that ends on Boxing Day.  A number of companies used the occasion that saw two streets sealed to showcase their products.
