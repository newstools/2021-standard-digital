Kisumu Governor Anyang' Nyong'o with PS State Department of ICT and Innovation Jerome Ochieng while commissioning the Rotary Youth Business incubation and innovation center in Kisumu on December 21, 2021. [Collins Oduor, Standard]  Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o has unveiled Kisumu’s Rotary and Incubation Centre to help promote skills development.  This comes three years after the institution was declared unfit for learning and human habitation by the Public Health department.  However, after the county launched an upgrade plan, it now has a new building with state of the art equipment.  “We shall be rolling out other such centres to allow innovators actualise their dreams,” Prof Nyong’o said.
