President Uhuru Kenyatta gave Kenyans an early Christmas gift when he announced that the cost of power will go down by 15 per cent effective December 12, 2021. The announcement was made during the Jamhuri Day celebrations on Monday.  The reduction will go down further by an additional 15 per cent by April 2022. Kenya is reputed to have some of the highest power tariffs globally, and that has had its toll on manufacturing.  The announcement was indeed good news for the average Kenyans and manufacturers who solely depend on electricity for production. The high cost of power in had driven some investors to neighbouring countries while others switched to solar power to cut costs.    Hopefully, the cut in tariffs will bring down the high cost of living and help Kenyans assailed by the ravages of Covid-19 to cope.
