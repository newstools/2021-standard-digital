Nyamira Senator Okong'o Mogeni and West Mugirango MP Vincent Kemosi have reconciled.  The two buried their differences during the funeral of former Education officer Jasper Nyakoe at Kebirigo on Christmas Eve.  Nyakoe was former Chief Justice David Maraga's cousin.   Maraga and his wife Eucabeth attended at the funeral alongside Borabu MP Ben Momanyi and his North Mugirango counterpart Joash Nyamoko.   Two months ago, the two leaders clashed over local politics and tea sub-sector reforms.     By James Omoro | 5 hours ago By Eric Abuga and Patrick Beja | 17 hours ago By Harold Odhiambo and Olivia Odhiambo | 1 day ago By Harold Odhiambo | 2 days ago Enjoy unlimited access to The Standard website at a 50% discount on the yearly plan.
