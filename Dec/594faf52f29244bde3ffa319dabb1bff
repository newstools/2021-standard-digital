Samuel Osoro, a Standard Six pupil at All Saints Academy in Trans Nzoia County, was found lying unconscious in his bedroom.  The boy’s father, Peter Osoro, who operates a shop in the area, told The Standard that his son passed by the shop and he gave him Sh20 to buy mutura at the adjacent butchery.  Samuel reportedly walked home barely 50 metres away and was served tea by his mother, Bartizeba Osoro.  The woman told neighbours she was doing chores when she called her son to send him to the shop.  “I realized he was not in the sitting room where he had switched on the TV. I entered his room and found him on the bed unconscious,” she said.  She alerted neighbours and rushed him to Cristal hospital in Kitale, where he was pronounced dead.   Trans-Nzoia County Commander, Jacinta Wesonga, said a post-mortem would be conducted to reveal the cause of the death.
