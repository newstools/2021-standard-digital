Githungo Primary School headteacher Joseph Karume displays the cane that was allegedly used by a teacher corporal punishment on five pupils who were late for afternoon classes. [Mose Sammy, Standard]  The proposal by CSs George Magoha and Fred Matiang'i to return the cane in schools is welcome and long overdue.  The removal of the cane was the biggest blunder we ever made in our education sector.  The disruption of learning as a result of indiscipline among learners coupled with huge losses due to the destruction of property can directly be traced back to the ban on caning in schools.  As a country, we lost it the moment the government issued a policy directive declaring caning in our schools illegal. We spared the rod, and the results are evident today. For a couple of years now, we have had a generation that has little regard for authority.  Many children, especially those from permissive backgrounds are now untouchable and have in some instances frustrated efforts by teachers to instill good values in learners.  The sooner we return the cane, the better for all of us. The only thing the government needs to do is ensure there are no excesses in administering the cane.
