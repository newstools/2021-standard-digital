Governor James Ongwae says Sh10 billion has been set aside for infrastructure development aimed at giving the town a facelift.  The allocation is under the Urban Economic Plan in conjunction with the World Bank.  Speaking during the launch of the Nyanchwa Estate-Kisii Town Link Road yesterday, Ongwae said Sh2 billion has already been mobilised for projects in Kisii town with more funds expected soon.  Projects to benefit under the programme include Kegati Water Project, Kisii Cancer Centre, Daraja Mbili Market, Kisii Town beautification and street lighting programme among other projects in the next couple of years.  “The county is partnering with the World Bank to ensure that Kisii Municipality which is projected to have over 400,000 residents by 2030, will have highly developed infrastructures,” said Ongwae. Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi said the newly constructed Nyanchwa Link Road will improve the prices of property in the area. “Governor Ongwae will leave a rich legacy.”  By Harold Odhiambo | 5 hours ago By Anne Atieno and Caleb Kingwara | 9 hours ago By Olivia Odhiambo | 17 hours ago By Edwin Nyarangi | 17 hours ago
