Eldoret High Court presiding judge Eric Ogola at Eldoret high court on November 3, 2021. [Christopher Kipsang, Standard]  The Judiciary will set up a claims court to settle commercial disputes whose value is below Sh1 million.  Eldoret presiding judge Eric Ogola has told court users in the region to be ready to embrace the court, which has already been gazetted.  While addressing a Court Users Committee in Eldoret, Justice Ogola hinted that the small claims court established under the Small Claims Act of 2016 will reduce case backlog.  The establishment of the court was announced by Chief Justice Martha Koome, who is also the president of the Supreme Court of Kenya, through the Kenya Gazette notice dated December 10. Justice Ogola welcomed the initiative, noting that the court will help in achieving the objectives of the Alternative Justice System.     By Christopher Kipsang | 8 hours ago By Lynn Kolongei | 8 hours ago By Kennedy Gachuhi | 9 hours ago By Titus Too | 13 hours ago
