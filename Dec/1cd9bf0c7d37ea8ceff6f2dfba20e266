The vagaries of nature move from one extreme to another with such rapidity they leave destruction in their wake. After long periods of drought and food insecurity, many parts of the country are now receiving heavy rains.  Unfortunately, rather than be a blessing, the rains have caused devastation in some of these areas. In Taveta sub-County for example, there are reports that ongoing heavy rains killed more than 1,500 livestock last week.  Houses and crops were also destroyed. This happens at a time most people are suffering due to the ravages of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Given the dire situation, the national and county governments, and humanitarian agencies should step in and offer assistance to the affected. Most of them are in need of shelter, clothing and food, which, in their present state, they cannot afford.     Humanitarian crisis looms as scores of evicted families camp in schools  IDPs take officials to sleuths  Families moved out of camp only to end up in another one  How cartels colluded to steal IDP billions  Displaced persons denounce the BBI Report, they claim their views were ignored by the team  Thousands of families displaced by floods to receive weekly stipend on their phones  Government promise to resettle IDPs By Patrick Muinde | 6 hours ago By Editorial | 6 hours ago By Jesse Mugo  | 6 hours ago By Esther Koimett | 6 hours ago
