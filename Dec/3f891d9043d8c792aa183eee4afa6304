Acting Clerk Nairobi City County Assembly, Gavin Castro, yesterday. [Samson Wire. Standard.]  The Nairobi County Assembly Service Board has appointed Principal Clerk Gavin Castro as acting clerk.  This is after the courts barred Deputy Clerk, Legislative Services, Adah Onyango from occupying the clerk’s office in an acting capacity.  While communicating the changes, Speaker Benson Mutura said Castro’s appointment followed a meeting by the board on Tuesday.  On Monday, Justice Mathews Nduma Nderi issued orders barring Onyango from her role as acting clerk pending the hearing and determination of an application by activist Okiya Omtatah.  Judge Nderi had also directed Adah to stop acting as the secretary of the board until the case was heard and determined in January 18, 2022.  “Thus in compliance with the court, the County Assembly Service Board resolved to appoint Castro as the acting clerk forthwith,” said John Kamangu, the stand-in speaker during a special sitting yesterday.  Omtatah had accused Onyango of violating the law by being in office in an acting capacity for more than the prescribed six months.      By Josphat Thiong’o | 7 hours ago By James Wanzala | 1 day ago By Betty Njeru | 5 days ago By Daniel Chege | 5 days ago Enjoy unlimited access to The Standard website at a 50% discount on the yearly plan.
