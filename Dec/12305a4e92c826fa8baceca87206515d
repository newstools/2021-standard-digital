Some of the houses which were destroyed at Koredo Village in Rachuonyo North Sub-county. [James Omoro, Standard]  A storm left more than 20 people homeless in Koredo Sub-location, Rachuonyo North sub-County.  At Aros trading centre, the storm blew off roofs of business premises and rental houses.  The storm also destroyed 10 houses and three churches in Koredo village.  This left many families in the cold and without basic commodities. However, Koredo assistant chief David Opere said there were no injuries during the incident.  “Traders have incurred huge losses and many families have been left in the cold as a result of the storm. Some families have sought accommodation from relatives,” Opere said.  He said traders at Aros market depend entirely on their businesses which were destroyed by the storm.  “The traders are stranded and cannot continue with their daily business operations at the market after their premises and products were destroyed,” Opere added.  The administrator appealed to the county government, national government, local leaders and well-wishers to intervene and take humanitarian aid to the victims.      By Harold Odhiambo | 10 hours ago By Anne Atieno | 17 hours ago By James Omoro | 23 hours ago By Harold Odhiambo | 23 hours ago Enjoy unlimited access to The Standard website at a 50% discount on the yearly plan.
