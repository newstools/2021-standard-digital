ODM leader Raila Odinga at the KICC on December 12, 2021. [Samson Wire, Standard]  ODM leader Raila Odinga arrived in Mombasa on Tuesday for a three-day vacation.  Raila said he was advised to rest after several campaign rallies in various parts of the country before the announcement of his presidential bid at Kasarani on Friday.  "I'm in Mombasa to rest for three days. I've not held any meeting today," he said.  The former prime minister is expected to start another phase of his campaigns in the next few days. Raila said he had not held talks with any political grouping since the Azimio la Umoja event.  "I was advised to rest after Kasarani. After the three days I will talk to different people and groups," he said, adding that he was working on a national movement that will alter the course of the country's political and economic landscape.  The ODM leader said he wants to bring everybody on board for the good of the country.  Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi on Sunday claimed his Pamoja Africa Alliance (PAA) has initiated partnership talks with ODM.  “We should ask ourselves how we will benefit from a Raila’s government because we shall give him our votes, but we have to know our stake as a region before elections,” he told women leaders in Malindi.  However, ODM Secretary-General denied the claims.  It is not clear whether Raila will meet Kingi during his stay at the Coast.  Other reports indicate that Central Organisation of Trade Unions Secretary-General Francis Atwoli and Jubilee Vice Chairman David Murathe were to meet the ODM leader later yesterday or today in the morning.
