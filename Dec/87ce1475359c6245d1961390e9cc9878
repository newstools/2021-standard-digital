Rescue operations at a building that collapsed in Murang’a four days ago have ended after two persons assumed to be casualties were found.  At 10am yesterday, operations by a multi-agency team were called off after one of the workers assumed to have been buried appeared at the site.  County Fire and Disaster Management head Bilha Wanjiku said the man recounted how he escaped from nearly being buried alive.    “After he showed up, he also gave details of another man he was with. The multi-agency team also managed to contact the second person and confirmed he was fine,” said Wanjiku. The rescue and search team had retrieved six bodies from the debris by Sunday. Police confirmed 58 people were working in the ill-fated building and managed to account for 43. The search for the missing then kicked off with support from Kenya Defence Force, National Youth Service and National Police Service.   Transport and Infrastructure CS James Macharia warned investors to ensure they follow regulations to curb incidents of buildings collapsing.     By Muriithi Mugo | 1 day ago By Muriithi Mugo | 1 day ago By Timothy Kariuki | 2 days ago By Boniface Gikandi | 3 days ago
