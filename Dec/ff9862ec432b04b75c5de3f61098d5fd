Crime scene barrier tape [Courtesy]  Police have arrested a man who is believed to have attacked his wife and two children with a machete in Nyakoe on Sunday.   Kisii County Police Commander Francis Kooli told The Standard that Daniel Asiago turned against Ednah Kerubo and their children following a domestic row.  The police boss said the three were taken to the Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital where they are undergoing treatment. “The suspect is being held at Nyatieko Police Station as we continue with investigations before taking him to court,” said Kooli.  Evans Oiko, a neighbour, said he had distress calls from the home and when he reached there, he found Kerubo and her two children writhing in pain. “Residents burnt down Asiago’s home since they could not understand why he savagely attacked his family,” said Oiko.      By James Omoro | 6 hours ago By Edwin Nyarangi | 6 hours ago By James Omoro | 8 hours ago By Edwin Nyarangi | 23 hours ago
