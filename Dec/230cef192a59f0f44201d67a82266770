The flower farm worker slashed the neck of the 23-year-old woman, leaving her to bleed to death.  According to neighbours, this was not the first time the couple was involved in a physical fight.  While confirming the incident, Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru said the suspect was in police custody and would be arraigned in court to face murder charges. “We recovered the murder weapon,” he said.  A witness, Sam Karimi said that the two lovers had had squabbles with the man accusing the woman of being unfaithful.  Trouble started on Wednesday night when the two engaged in a fight before the man stabbed the woman on the neck on Thursday morning.  Meanwhile, police in Naivasha are holding a former senior prisons officer who was found in possession of a fake pistol.  The former officer was nabbed in one of the construction sites near the town after he confronted some workers claiming that the land was his.  Police who were called in following the altercation were shocked to find the suspect brandishing the gun in the air threatening to shoot the workers on the site.
