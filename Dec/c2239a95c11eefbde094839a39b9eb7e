On this particular day, there are no fishing nets as the boat riders gathered for the annual Jomvu boat racing festival. The race held on Monday attracted hundreds of participants and revellers.  Four teams of fishermen from several Beach Management Units (BMUs) in Jomvu Constituency descended on Mkupe Beach for the contest.  Jomvu MP Badi Twalib has for the past nine years, through National Government Constituencies Development Fund (NG-CDF), been organising the competition. This year seasoned boat rider Hamza Kombo was the convener of the day's events that have attracted a mammoth crowd.  "It is Season 9 of this treacherous race over the calm water of the expansive Port Reitz creek. Men in ngalawa race from the start to the finish point," Hamza said before the start of the race.  Badi has lined up several goodies for the winner, which includes Sh40,000, medals, and certificates for the team that will finish first.  Mkupe BMU team of Ismail Mandalo and Gereza Mazera emerged winners.  Second spot gets away with Sh30,000, medals and certificates while second runners-up bags Sh15,000.  Mikindani BMU team of Madeni Bakari and Mashanga Khamisi came second while position three was a tie between Jomvu and Ngare BMUs.
