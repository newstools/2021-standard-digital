Police in Nakuru marked Christmas differently this year after they joined less fortunate families for feasting and entertainment.   In Bahati, Nakuru North Sub-County Police Commander Samson Andanje led a team of officers to Welcome Family Home, a children’s rescue centre in Pipeline area.  The officers delivered food and non-food donations purchased through contributions from their pockets.   “Christmas is a time to share and celebrate. We are all morally duty-bound to put a smile on the face of those who don’t have in our society,” said Mr Andanje.   The Interior Ministry last week recalled police officers on leave to beef up security countrywide, keeping them away from their families. “Measures are in place to ensure the area is secured as a few representatives celebrate this day with the children. This time, we consider these children as our family to celebrate with,” said Andanje.  Wilson Thuo, a police officer, underscored the need to support such facilities throughout the year, citing heavy economic burden on their sponsors. “When we rescue children, they are at times rejected at rescue centres because of costs involved,” said Thuo.       By Kennedy Gachuhi | 55 minutes ago By Antony Gitonga | 11 hours ago By Lynn Kolongei | 12 hours ago By Nikko Tanui | 13 hours ago Enjoy unlimited access to The Standard website at a 50% discount on the yearly plan.
