Osotua Esiteti Maasai Women group leaders. [Robert Menza, Standard]  A group of Maasai women living next to Amboseli National Park is a happy lot.  The women's group has landed a lucrative deal to make and export beads and necklaces to a UK based firm.  Osotua Esiteti Community Based Organising (CBO) chairperson Esther Katamboi yesterday told The Standard the deal funded by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) had changed their lives.   "Our preoccupation is mostly herding livestock and we also rely on tourism. Covid-19 hit us hard and with failed rains, things were really hard for us. This project is timely," she said. Dubbed Inua Kijiji venture, some 179 Maasai women joined hands and started doing beadwork for export.   Daisy Ochiel, a Female Empowerment Assistant at IFAW, who is working within the Amboseli eco-system, said the women were taken through training to get the right skills.   "This project has benefited more than 819 residents. The women are involved in the art-making of creative beads, bracelets and fabrics decorated with beads," said Ms Ochiel.  She said since creative bracelets, necklaces and beads were part of the Maasai culture and dressing, the women readily accepted the challenge.   Further, the women own and run a ration shop that offers food supplies to teams at Community Game Rangers within the Amboseli National Park and adjacent conservancies.   IFAW President and CEO Azzedine Downes said their organisation continued to support the communities to encourage conservation efforts.
