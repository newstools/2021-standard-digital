Interior CS Dr Fred Matiangi, 2021. [Samson Wire, Standard]  Deputy President William Ruto’s allies have lashed out at Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i for instructing administrators to toe President Uhuru Kenyatta’s line.  Speaking during the DP's tour of Nakuru yesterday, Garissa Township MP Aden Duale said Matiang'i can use any other method but he cannot violate the bill of rights that gives all Kenyans, including civil servants, the right to choose the leaders they want.  “What Matiang’i said is not the language of President Uhuru whom I know. This is the creation of a person who wants to intimidate those in lower levels of government,” said Duale.  Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichung’wah urged Matiang’i to stop politicising the security docket as the General Election nears.  “Matiang’i has no option but to keep his politics off the security docket. The chiefs are under obligation to follow instructions from the president and his office but this does not extend to political choices,” said Ichung’wah.   Nakuru Senator Susan Kihika urged the administrators to objectively perform their duties to instil confidence among ordinary Kenyans.   Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua warned senior State officers abusing their offices of consequences that would follow them once their tenure is over.   Ruto claimed State machinery is working to frustrate his bid in favour of a particular candidate. “They have run out of strategies and now turned into intimidation through government officers. We have beat them in the past and we shall still beat them in the next election,” said the DP.
