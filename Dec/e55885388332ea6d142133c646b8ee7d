The Health Ministry has given Kenyans until December 21 to get vaccinated against Covid-19 or risk missing crucial government services.  While the threat is enough to make some people to line up for the jab, it should not  entirely be the reason for you go for vaccination.  The threat of sanction, perhaps, indicates the government has not done enough to educate Kenyans on the importance of getting vaccinated and in debunking the myths and falsehoods surrounding the vaccines. This is because if people understand fully the advantages of the vaccines, they would be rushing to get vaccinated.  The truth is, these vaccines offer the best protection against this killer disease. In fact, the World Health Organisation has indicated that they might be efficient against the Omicron variant that is spreading around the world like wildfire. One more reason why you should get vaccinated.
