More than 300 students of Ringa Boys High School in Homa Bay are worried about sleeping in the cold after their dormitory was burnt down.  The dormitory that housed 307 students was razed on Wednesday at dawn. Majority of the students are Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education candidates.  According to the principal, Austin Muma, nothing was salvaged from the dorm.  Muma said the fire broke out when students were in class.    “The students were in class when they realised that fire had broken out. They did not salvage anything since by the time they arrived at the scene, the dormitory was engulfed in flames,” Muma said.  The cause of the fire has not been established.  The principal called on well-wishers to help his students with humanitarian aid.  “I still don’t know where the students will sleep because the dormitory is no longer habitable,” he said.  The incident disrupted learning at the school on Wednesday.  Homa Bay County Commissioner Moses Lilan confirmed that nobody lost their lives in the incident.  Lilan said they were organising emergency response to ensure the students get accommodation.  “It is a sad incident and we are trying to get the students accommodation,” Lilan said.  The police boss said investigations into the incident had been launched.  By James Omoro | 1 day ago By James Omoro | 2 days ago By Olivia Odhiambo | 2 days ago By Isaiah Gwengi | 3 days ago
