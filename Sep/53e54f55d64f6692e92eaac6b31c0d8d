[Courtesy]  A court has ordered a private security firm to pay a former night guard Sh171,000 for allegedly dismissing him after he asked to be directed to a toilet for a short call.  Justice Bernard Odongo of the Employment and Labour Relations Court in Nairobi found that Johnson Otsieno Ogola was dismissed unfairly by his former employer Hatari Security Guards Limited.  Mr Odongo established that Ogola was not accorded procedural fairness in the process leading to his termination.  He issued a declaration that Ogola’s contract of service was terminated unlawfully.  Attorney General wants labour court to hear jab case against State  Not all medics can go on strike, court now rules  It's unconstitutional to fire staff on probation at will, court rules  Banker who was sacked ‘by computer system’ awarded Sh 6.5 million The court said there was no evidence that the night guard proceeded on leave during two years of service.
