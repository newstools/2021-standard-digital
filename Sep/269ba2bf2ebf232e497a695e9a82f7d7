National Treasury and Planning Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani has today launched the 2021 Economic Survey Report.  Here’s his full speech:   In the generation of statistical reports, the key stages include field data collection, data analysis, data validation and peer review.  In 2021, there are two main factors that affected the timely production of the report, namely; the Covid-19 pandemic and the National Accounts Statistics revision and rebasing process.  Firstly, the unprecedented challenge of Covid-19 has impacted negatively on the availability of statistics while also occasioning late submission of some of the requisite information by the data producers for preparation of the report.  Kenya’s moment of truth as Treasury reviews economy  Economic survey 2021 set for release  National Treasury seeks Budget views early ahead of polls  Treasury on the spot over parastatals defaulting on government lent loans The late submission of the data affected the subsequent stages in the compilation of the 2021 Economic Survey report. This challenge is not only unique to Kenya but has also affected other countries.  Secondly, revision and rebasing of the national accounts is a normal statistical procedure undertaken by national statistical office to ensure that key macroeconomic statistics - such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - present the most up-to-date reflection of the economy.  Revisions which are indeed routine part of dissemination of quality statistics, are undertaken to incorporate better source data; adoption of new methodological or conceptual framework; updating base periods; and correction of errors among other improvements. To minimize disruptions to users and frequent revisions, for instance through structural breaks in time series, alignment with change of base period exercise (rebasing) is preferred.  The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics initiated the process of revising and rebasing the national accounts in 2017.  The revision process entailed; taking stock of the available data and assessing their suitability; formulation of a data collection strategy to fill the gaps; conducting various surveys and censuses; analyzing and validating the data; compilation of revised and rebased estimates and; a consultative review of the revised estimates.  Among the key surveys and censuses that informed the revision and rebasing include: 2017 Census of Industrial Production; 2017 Integrated Survey of Services; 2015/16 Kenya Integrated Household Survey; 2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census; 2016 Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Survey; as well as a number of improved data from administrative records.  The revision and rebasing exercise significantly benefited from the macro working groups, technical support of Statistics of Sweden and the IMF East AFRITAC before finalization in readiness for dissemination.  The revision and rebasing process has resulted to: improved compliance with the 2008 System of National Accounts which contains the latest compilation guidelines; improved coverage of economic activities due to improved data sources; better estimates of the size of the economy and growth rate and; overall improvement in accuracy, consistency and reliability of the national accounts estimates.  A detailed report on the revision and rebasing process is now available on the KNBS website and we regret the delay which was primarily caused by the need for a tradeoff between timeliness and accuracy of the official statistics.  Today, as we launch the Economic Survey Report, which provides information on sectoral performance of the economy in the last five years, we need to be alive to the fact that our economy like others still faces the negative impacts of the Covid-19. This report provides;  1. Highlights of Rebasing of the Construction Input Index  2. and Analysis of Nutritional Anthropometric Trends in Kenya.   The highlights of the 2021 Economic Survey Report  International scene  The global economy was estimated to have contracted by 4.2 per cent in 2020 compared to a growth of 2.7per cent in 2019.  The contraction was attributed to; Emergence of Covid-19 which significantly constrained economic activity as well as decline in oil prices due to dwindling demand.  Economies in the OECD contracted by 5.5 per cent   in 2020 compared to a growth of 1.6 per cent in 2019.  Sub-Saharan African Real GDP contracted by 1.9 per cent   in 2020 compared to 3.2 per cent   growth in 2019 mainly owing to; restrictions associated with Covid-19 pandemic negatively affected tourism and international while also exacerbating debt burden.  Domestic economy  In 2020, Kenya’s economy was adversely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic resulting in significant slowed down economic activities.  During the review period, the government's priority was to safeguard citizens’ lives while at the same time cushioning the economy from the effects of Covid-19.  The restriction in movements and social distancing led to disruption in labour supply, leading to reduced demand for goods and services.  Accordingly, many businesses especially service industries like tourism significantly slowed down during the second quarter of 2020.  However, pick up of economic activities resumed in the third quarter of 2020 with notable improvement in the fourth quarter of 2020. By and large the containment measures constrained the economy from realizing its full potential.  Agriculture sector   The agriculture sector grew by 4.6 per cent in 2020 compared to a revised growth of 2.3 per cent in 2019. This was on account of favorable weather conditions in 2020 which improved production of food crops such as beans, rice, sorghum and millet and, livestock and related products such as milk and meat.  Tea production increased by 24.1 per cent from 458.8 thousand tonnes in 2019 to 569.5 thousand tonnes in 2020.

Overall Performance of the domestic Economy  The revised nominal GDP was estimated at 10.753 trillion in 2020 from 10.256 trillion in 2019.  The economic performance as measured by Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated to have contracted by 0.3 per cent in 2020 compared to a growth of 5.0 per cent in 2019.  The contraction in Economic performance was attributed to;  Disruption in labour supply brought about by restriction of movement and social distancing meant to contain the spread of Covid-19  Reduced demands for goods and services.  The large contraction in tourism and related activities was partly offset by growth in the Construction and Health sectors both driven by continued investment in public infrastructure and Health.  The Government is currently focusing on the implementation of the Economic Recovery Strategy (ERS) that aims at restoring the economy to a strong growth path, creating jobs and economic opportunities across all regions of the country with a view to tackling social and income inequalities. It is expected that the successful implementation of the Economic Recovery Strategy which is also aligned to the “Big Four” Agenda will promote inclusive growth and transform the lives of Kenyans.  Economic Outlook   Global  Globally, most of the developing economies are projected to experience a more challenging recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic compared to their developed economies counterpart.  This is largely so because of the uneven access to Covid-19 vaccine which is therefore likely to impact negatively on the full resumption of economic activities in the developing economies.  The global economic growth is expected to rebound to 5.6 per cent in 2021.  Consequently, the volume of world merchandise trade is projected to expand by 8.0 per cent in 2021 after a contraction of 5.3 per cent in 2020.  The growth in the world trade is expected to boost external demand for Kenya’s products and thereby likely to augment the country’s economic growth.  Domestic  Domestically, oil prices have been rising significantly in response to the global price rise.  On average, the international oil prices are likely to be higher. Effectively then, oil prices in Kenya will probably remain high and therefore counterproductive to economic growth.  On average, inflation was lower in the first quarter of 2021 compared to a similar quarter of 2020. However, there was a rise in the inflation rate during the second quarter and this trend is likely to continue in the second half of 2021 due to higher energy and transportation prices.  The country has so far experienced below normal rainfall in the first half of 2021.  However, the weather forecast points to the possibility of the short rains being better in most parts of the country later in the year.  Output of the agriculture sector, which is largely rain fed, is therefore likely to be lower than the 2020 level.  Full resumption of activities in the education sector and the hotel industry that were almost halted for the better part of 2020, is likely to significantly boost the growth.  Other key sectors like manufacturing and transportation are likely to rebound and support the country’s economic growth.  The key macroeconomic indicators will most probably remain stable and supportive of growth in 2021, the economy is therefore expected to record a significant rebound in 2021.  Conclusion  The importance of quality statistics for effective planning, monitoring and evaluation of Government programs cannot be overemphasized. In this regard, My Ministry will continue to provide the much needed financial and other support to facilitate the Bureau in undertaking critical data production programs.  I would like to thank the businesses and households that provided data used for preparing the Economic Survey Publication. I also wish to thank the Ministries, Departments and Agencies for providing the administrative data used in the report. I wish to recognize the unwavering support of our development partners for facilitating statistical activities and for enabling various surveys and analyses to be undertaken. The Bureau will continue to uphold confidentiality in handling the information given and will only use it for statistical purposes.  In conclusion, I urge all stakeholders to make use of the invaluable information contained in the report for better targeting of programs and initiatives to yield more desirable and efficient economic outcomes.
