Five police officers will be charged with murder at the High Court in Nairobi tomorrow.  The officers are Khalif Abdulahi Sigat, James Muli Koti, Joseph Odhiambo Sirawa, Edward Kongo Onchonga and Nelson Nkanae.  They are linked to the death of Caleb Otieno at the Changamwe Police Station, Mombasa.  A statement from the Independent Policing Oversight Authority said Otieno died hours after he was arrested on suspicion of having illegal alcohol – Changáa – at Mikindani on September 18, 2018.  Father Wamugunda denies child, appeals decision to pay Sh25,000 monthly upkeep  Petitioner loses bid to stop new IEBC members' swearing-in  Court reverses deregistration of artistes agencies  Family of slain journalist William Munuhe demands answers over delayed justice Four of the officers were arrested separately in Mombasa and Nairobi, while the other is still at large but has been ordered to surrender.  IPOA investigated the death after the Officer Commanding the Station notified it of the incident.  Police officers are bound to report such deaths and serious injuries.  A postmortem examination showed Otieno died of multiple injuries inflicted with blunt force.  IPOA got witness statements, including police officers who were on duty and others who saw Otieno when he was arrested.  He was arrested at 6pm and booked at the station as “unknown".  IPOA says at around 9pm he was removed from the cells and later transferred to the Coast General Hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival.
