Kenyans have been whining that they have been let down by this or that elected leader. Bad leaders are products of our electoral choices. During next year's General Election, we have a chance to kick out the leaders who will not have fulfilled their promises.   To do that, however, one, and especially the many young people who have just reached the age of 18 and who are yearning for change, must first register as a voter.  This is the time to do that. Beginning October 4, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission will roll out voter registration exercise.   The commission hopes to register between six and seven million new voters.

Failing to register and vote is to vote in mediocre leaders.      Kenyans in eleven countries to vote in next year's election  Leaders set out to shore up voter numbers in Nyanza and Western  MPs back as House enters homestretch  Why next year's election is unlikely to trigger violence  Raila and Kalonzo's unity plot ahead of 2022 general elections | INSIDE POLITICS WITH BEN KITILI  New Democratic Party, TND announces it will field a presidential candidate for 2022 elections  Leo Mashinani Machi 15 2016: Tathmini ya usajili By Editorial | 20 minutes ago By Editorial | 1 day ago By Editorial | 1 day ago By Editorial | 2 days ago
