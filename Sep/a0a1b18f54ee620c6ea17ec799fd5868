The body of a 60-year-old mason which had been detained by a hospital for the last three months over a Sh900,000-bill has finally been buried.  Tears flowed as the hearse carrying the body arrived at a sleepy village in the interior of Kiambu County bordering Mai Mahiu area.  Paul Mburu was interred at Ndiuni village following intervention by neighbours and the county government.  Following the death of the man 90 days ago after a long illness, his body was detained by the hospital after the family failed to pay the outstanding bill.    SIM swap fraud suspects to be arraigned in Kiambu  Raila Odinga attends online supporter's 22nd birthday party  Paradise lost: Three siblings in epic battle for Sh2.1b estate  Residents petition Uhuru, City Hall over 257-acre land dispute The death of the father of 13 plunged the family into misery who have tried to sell off their property to raise funds.
