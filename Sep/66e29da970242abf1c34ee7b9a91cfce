Baringo Senator Gideon Moi has urged the Government to tame the fuel price spike, which has sparked protests in certain parts of the country.  Speaking in Moiben, Uasin Gishu County on Saturday, September 18, the senator advised the Government to put in place measures that would cushion Kenyans against paying hefty costs for the commodity.  Moi made the remarks at Kapsubere Village during the burial of Susana Gogo Tiren, the mother of Moiben Member of Parliament Silas Tiren.  “Sound policies and directives by the State would see the spike in fuel prices tamed,” he said.  The legislator said high fuel prices negatively impact Kenyans’ purchasing power as inflation tends to rise.  Lower prices immediately, say leaders in fuel cost hike backlash   Can’t make ends meet?
