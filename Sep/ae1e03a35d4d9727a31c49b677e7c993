The Employment and Labour Relations Court has declared null and void a November 2018 notice by Maasai Mara University capping the retirement age of its non-teaching staff at 60.  Justice Hellen Wasilwa delivered the judgment last week following a case by Cleophas Serem. The judge said the November 22, 2018 notice of retirement varying the contract of employment was unlawful and unfair.  Dr Serem, being among those affected by the notice, sued the university in 2019 seeking orders quashing the notice. He also wanted to be retained in the position he held as a medical officer without loss of any benefits until his retirement age of 65, as indicated in his contract of employment of September 2009.  In the suit, Serem said the university, on November 22, 2018, issued a notice of retirement that changed the retirement age from 65 to 60.  Youth urged to exploit digital skills for employment  Samir Nasri announces retirement from football at the age of 34  How retired couple built a business empire in a Siaya village  Mary Njeri: University student by day, security guard by night “I find the claimant (Serem) has established his case against the respondent (university) and I, therefore, declare the Notice of Retirement dated November 22, 2018, varying the contract of employment is unlawful and unfair,” read the court judgment.     Many turn to retirement benefits as pandemic ravages the economy  Tourism Sector hit by Pandemic, massive losses and unemployment  Unemployment Woes: How can young people position themselves for success in the Job Market Right Now?
