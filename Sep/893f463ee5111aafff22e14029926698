The national government will provide Sh500 million for the construction of a cancer centre in Kakamega.  According to Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, the unit will help address the rising cases of cancer and ease the cost of treatment.  The cancer centre is among projects that President Uhuru Kenyatta is expected to launch during his upcoming tour of the region.  “We are happy that the project has been budgeted for,” said Oparanya. The funds were allocated this financial year.   The facility will be constructed at Kakamega County Referral Hospital.  Why men die earlier than women  Bomet: The hotspot of ‘painful swallowing’  Anger over sewer charges in Kakamega  Muyoti named FKF-PL July coach of the month   Quality treatment  “The new centre will reduce the cost of cancer treatment. It will also guarantee patients quality treatment without having to travel to either the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret, Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi or abroad for treatment,” said the governor.  Dr Hilda Mubisi, the head of the cancer centre at the Kakamega county hospital, said the funds will be used to construct and equip the facility.  “The new facility will enable us to offer comprehensive cancer treatment, including radiotherapy, which we are currently not offering,” said Dr Mubisi, adding that the number of patients suffering from esophageal cancer was on the rise.  Between 2018 and 2020, the regional facility recorded about 219 cases of esophageal cancer.      FKF Premier League results: Posta Rangers 1-3 Kakamega Homeboyz, Ulinzi Stars 1-0 Nzoia Sugar  Kakamega twins to take different career paths after registering different grades in the KCSE 2020  Pacha wa Kakamega wafaulu katika mtihani wa KCSE 2020, walitambulika sana baada ya kupatana By Anne Atieno | 2 days ago By Robert Amalemba | 3 days ago By Brian Kisanji | 4 days ago By Alexander Chagema | 5 days ago
