The building tilted on Friday before it crumbled as residents watched. [George Njunge, Standard]  The county government has distanced itself from a poorly-constructed building that collapsed in Kinoo, Kikuyu sub-county.  Through Housing Executive Mugo Kimani, the county said it warned the owners of the building, George Kamau and Florence Wairimu, to stop the construction in January but they defied the order.  Kimani said on January 18, the county government wrote to the owners, warning them that the building was being constructed without the relevant approvals from the county.    Leaning Kinoo building safely brought down   Why Kinoo building is crumbling  One dead, several trapped as five-storey building collapses in Gachie  Mason recalls how crane fell, killing nine workers On Monday, Kimani ordered the immediate demolition of the building.
