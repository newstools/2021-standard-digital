National Election Board chair Catherine Mumma. [Edward Kiplimo, Standard]  ODM factions in Tana River County have agreed to end their differences and work towards building the party ahead of the 2022 polls.  This was after the party National Election Board (NEB) gave them a 21-day notice to end the wars or quit the outfit.  NEB chairperson Catherine Mumma said wrangles that had bedevilled the party for four years, should end before it holds grassroots elections.  The three factions led by Governor Dhadho Godhana, his critic Adam Barisa and the party's branch chairperson Alfeit Mumba have engaged in supremacy battles in the running of the party.  Western Kenya politics: Raila, Malala clash  Raila and Ruto: Arch-rivals who mirror each other in vote hunt  DP Ruto: Sell your agenda instead of castigating mine  Raila woos traders, asks State to protect them Mumma said the wrangles cost the party seats in the county in 2017 and that the ODM leadership is concerned that it could again affect its chances in next year's elections.  "You can't be wrangling on positions day in day out just because you want to lead others. This is not helping the party and Raila Odinga," said Mumma.  In a tense meeting in Hola town yesterday, Mumma directed the three camps to reconcile.  Delegates from three sub-counties agreed to reconcile and promote the party's interests ahead of next year's General Election.        Raila Odinga is set to begin a 2-day in Western Kenya, he is to have consultative meetings  Raila comes up with a platform which he says will harmonize major issues affecting ordinary citizens  Raila Odinga has given the clearest indication yet that he is ready to work with One Kenya Alliance By Mireri Junior | 5 hours ago By Brian Otieno and Robert Amalemba | 17 hours ago By Allan Mungai | 17 hours ago By Roselyne Obala | 23 hours ago
