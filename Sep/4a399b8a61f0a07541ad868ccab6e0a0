Somalia's President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed in Mogadishu on May 27, 2021. [Reuters]  Voting for members of Somalia's lower house of parliament has been rescheduled for late November, a move that will delay the indirect election of a president.  Voting for lawmakers by elders had been due to be completed this week, with the election of a speaker and swearing-in of members of parliament happening next week -- in time for them to pick a president on Oct. 10.  But an election implementation commission has drawn up a new timetable for the drawn-out process showing that lawmakers will be picked between October 1 and November 20.  The timetable, seen by Reuters, did not give a date for when the lawmakers will elect a president.  Matiang’i's grilling and shame of sham parliamentary probes  MPs on the spot again for cozying up to witnesses  Inside DP William Ruto’s security detail  Matiang'i: Ruto has biggest security detail in history The current government's term expired in February.
