[Reuters]  The Ugandan government has eased some of the Covid-19 measures imposed on the public, urging its citizens to be vaccinated.  This comes at a time when the country has registered 122,502 confirmed cases and 3,135 deaths since the pandemic started.  In a press statement on Wednesday, September 22, President Yoweri Museveni said that they were prioritising the vaccination of the 4.8 million priority population, majorly consisting of the vulnerable.  “Government continues to carry out extensive mobilization of COVID-19 vaccines and by the end of December 2021, we expect about 12 million doses,” Museveni’s statement read in part.  Uhuru calls for fairness in accessing Covid-19 jab  Kenyans to isolate despite UK Covishield nod  It’s time for government to lift the night curfew  Covid-19: Kenya administers 3.5 vaccines as death toll hits 5,045 “As of now, we have 2,294,000 doses of vaccines available at the National Medical Stores (NMS) out of 11,978,840 million doses expected by end of December 2021,” he added.
