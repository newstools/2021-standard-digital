Jubilee Party will consider a request by the Ogiek to reserve the senate nomination slot for the community.  Yesterday, Jubilee Secretary General Raphael Tuju said the party's National Management Committee will adhere to the law when picking the replacement for the late nominated Senator Victor Prengei.  “We are alive to the rules and regulations governing party nominations. The position belongs to the minority community, and it shall remain so,” Mr Tuju told The Standard.  He said the party was waiting for Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka to issue writs and the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) to declare the seat vacant before the process to pick a replacement begins.    Gideon Moi roots for an Ogiek to replace Prengei  Uhuru reads riot act to Jubilee leaders and pledges to unite Mt Kenya political parties    Photos: DP William Ruto at Senator Victor Prengei’s funeral  Senators eulogise Victor Prengei as quiet man driven by conviction Tuju revealed that Jubilee would not follow the party list that was presented to IEBC before the last General Election. “This is a different situation since the vacant seat belongs to a minority group. We cannot rely on the party list but look for another person from the minority community,” he said.  Tuju noted that he will consider the views of the Ogiek Council of Elders and a section of politicians on Prengei's replacement. “The Ogiek council of elders is not recognized in our party structures, but we will consider their views on Prengei's replacement,” he said.      Raphael Tuju walks for 52kms to raise funds to buy medical equipment for the Kijabe Hospital  Tuju atembea kutoka Karen hadI Kijabe kwa ajili ya kuchangisha pesa kununa vifaa vya matibabu  Jubilee party to hold countrywide grassroot elections which will culminate to national elections By Amos Kareithi | 19 seconds ago By Kamau Muthoni | 3 hours ago By Kamau Muthoni | 10 hours ago By Moses Nyamori | 10 hours ago
