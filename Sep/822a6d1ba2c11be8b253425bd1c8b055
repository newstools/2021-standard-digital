More than 3,000 Identity Cards (IDs) are uncollected at various offices of the National Registration Bureau in Siaya County.  With only months remaining before the next elections, Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) leaders in the county have embarked on an ambitious initiative to increase their vote basket.  County registrar of persons Dickson Osore said the over 3,000 IDs were lying in about 19 centres including several offices of chiefs across Siaya.  Osore was speaking during an ID registration programme in Boro chief's camp in Alego Usonga which was organised by Dr Julie Onyango.    Siaya twilight girls plead with county to step in after exit of local NGO  Governor Rasanga, Oduol set to renew political rivalry   Youths block Wanjigi’s motorcade in Siaya 'demanding handouts'  Siaya man traces wife to drinking den, clobbers her to death Osore asked those who had registered to check with their respective chiefs who are in possession of the vital document.  "We appeal to those who had applied for their IDs to come for them. It is unfortunate that even at the chief's offices they remain uncollected," he noted.  Osore also appealed to those who are yet to register to ensure they do so.
