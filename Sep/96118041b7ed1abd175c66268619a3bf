Baringo Senator Gideon Moi (centre) acknowledges Kanu delegates at the Bomas of Kenya. [Denish Ochieng, Standard]  Baringo Senator Gideon Moi has been endorsed by over 3,000 delegates as Kanu's presidential candidate in the 2022 elections.  In a major show of confidence in his leadership, the delegates, who thronged the historic Bomas of Kenya early September 30, unanimously mandated Gideon to make his first stab at the presidency – more than 19 years after the independence party made a challenge for the top seat.  Photos of the delegates and guests, among them ODM leader Raila Odinga and party leaders Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) and Musalia Mudavadi (ANC), captured the burst of euphoria surrounding the party’s expected endorsement and the rebirth of Gideon as he seeks to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta.  And it was a sea of Kanu flags.
