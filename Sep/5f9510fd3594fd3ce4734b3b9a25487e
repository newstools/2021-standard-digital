Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) soldiers greet people as they secure a site where Lieutenant-General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, deputy head of the military council and head of RSF, attends a meeting in Khartoum in June. [Reuters]  Sudanese authorities have contained a coup attempt and the situation has been brought under control, a member of the country's ruling council told Reuters Tuesday.  Interrogation of suspects involved in the attempted coup on Monday was due to begin and the military would issue a statement shortly, spokesman Mohamed Al Faki Suleiman said.  A government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the coup attempt had involved an effort to take control of state radio in Omdurman, across the Nile from the capital, Khartoum.  Measures were being taken to contain a limited number of people involved, the source said.  Sudan says coup thwarted, accuses Bashir loyalists  South Sudan minister Lomuro given access to frozen account  South Sudan minister faults US, UK over bank woes  Truckers want container deadline extended after attacks in S Sudan A witness said that the military had used tanks to close a bridge connecting Khartoum with Omdurman early on Tuesday morning.
