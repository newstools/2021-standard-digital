A row has erupted following a proposal to give the Murang’a Water and Sanitation a larger coverage area.  The Murang’a Municipal board has elected to pick Murang’a Water and Sanitation Company (Muwasco) to operate in areas that Kahuti, Gatamathi and Murang’a South Water companies have been assigned by the Water Service Regulatory Board (Wasreb). Municipal board vice chair James Waweru said the expansion of the Murang’a municipality boundaries was in line with the law to serve at least 100,000, up from the current 30,000 people he termed inadequate.  In July, the municipal and Muwasco boards met and resolved to partner in the distribution of water beyond Maragua Town, which is currently served by Muswasco, Mukangu area under Kahuti, and parts of Gaturi ward assigned to Gatamathi.  A proposal drafted in July by the water and the municipal boards is currently only awaiting approval by the regulator.  In the proposal seen by The Standard, the Municipal boundaries will extend towards Gaturi Ward, ending at Kaweru market on the Murang’a-Kiria-ini highway.  A highway thief and a telephone call that cut short a man’s life  A highway thief and a telephone call that cut short a man’s life  Water tunnel stalls over Sh3.5b to finish project  President Uhuru visits humble Siaya family  Along the Murang’a-Sagana road, the boundary will be extended from Mathioya River bridge to Sagana bridge, an area currently under Gatamathi Water Company.  In Maragua, Muwasco will be accorded the right to distribute water from Maragua River bridge to the area near Midway and Sammer village.  Municipal Board Vice-Chairman James Waweru confirmed the proposal, saying Muwasco had the capacity to provide the required volumes of water in underserved areas.     Maralal residents protest against water shortage that has been ongoing for two years now  Wakaazi wa Kaunti ya Mandera wakumbwa na uhaba wa maji, wanang'ang'ania kisima moja na mifugo  Highrise estate residents at the mercy of water tankers as they decry water shortage in the area By Paul Ogemba | 6 days ago By James Munyeki | 7 days ago By Fidelis Kabunyi | 7 days ago By Nderitu Gichure  | 8 days ago
