Tiaty MP William Kamket will remain in police custody until tomorrow when the court will rule on whether to have him detained for 14 more days or charge him.  Senior Principal Magistrate Lilian Arika ordered that the Kanu legislator be taken to the Rift Valley Provincial General Hospital in Nakuru for treatment after his lawyer Kipkoech Ng'etich said he was unwell.  Kamket was arrested on Wednesday in connection with the violence in Laikipia County that has left eight people dead.     Senior Assistant Director of Public Prosecution Alloys Kemo said the offences that Kamket is linked to had led to the loss of lives, grave injuries, and displacement of people within Laikipia County.  Police seek 14-day detention for Tiaty MP William Kamket over Laikipia violence  Laikipia violence: Tiaty MP William Kamket in court  Tiaty MP Kamket and former legislator Lempurkel arrested over Laikipia violence  Tiaty MP William Kamket faces incitement charges over Laikipia violence "There are several aspects of the case yet to be concluded, including recording of statements from witnesses, obtaining postmortem reports of deceased persons, and tracing and arresting of suspected perpetrators, thus ample time required to complete investigations," reads the application in part.  But his lawyer put up a spirited fight to have his client released on bond, saying the state had nothing against him.  Kipkoech asked the court to advise the government and the Inspector General of Police Hilary Mutyambai to consider resigning.  “When an entire county has its security apparatus breached, this is a situation that calls for national security council and not the arrest of one MP,” he told the court.  jchepkwony@standardmedia.co.ke        Mahakama kuu yabatilisha uamuzi wa kumwondoa mamlakani Baringo William Kamket  Baringo county speaker William Kamket reinstated after he won a case that sought his suspension  Governors who refuse to step aside risk having their county accounts frozen  By Lucas Ngasike | 2 hours ago By Julius Chepkwony | 2 hours ago By Yvonne Chepkwony | 3 hours ago By Betty Njeru | 3 hours ago
