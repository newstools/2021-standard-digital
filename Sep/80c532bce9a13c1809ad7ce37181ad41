More than 30 people have died because a health workers' strike in Guinea-Bissau has paralysed the healthcare system, a spokesperson for the nurses' union said on Wednesday.  The boycott over working conditions pays and other issues were launched on Monday in the small West African nation where chronically under-equipped hospitals and clinics have long angered workers and endangered patients.  "I hold the government responsible for the death toll and for the boycott which has completely paralysed the health sector nationwide," nurses' union spokesperson Garcia Batican Sampaio told a press conference.  Responding to the strike, government spokesman Fernando Vaz said "those responsible for this tragedy will be brought to justice".  Political instability has blighted Guinea Bissau for decades. Nine coups or attempted coups since independence from Portugal in 1974 have hobbled efforts to pull the economy beyond its reliance on the export of cashew nuts.  Stalemate as group A kicks off AFCON in Gabon   Africa Cup of Nations squads and Fixtures (Kenyan Time)  Origi is part of the team– Okumbi  CROWD TROUBLE INVITES CAF WRATH: FKF fined Sh1m over fans distress in Guinea Bissau tie Most medical clinics lack electricity or water supply, salaries are low, and maternal mortality rates are among the worst in the world, according to a 2017 UN human rights report that called for comprehensive reform.
