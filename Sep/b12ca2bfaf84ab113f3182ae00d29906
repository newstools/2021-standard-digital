A High Court has issued orders staying the directive by Rift Valley Regional Commissioner George Natembeya that indefinitely suspended operations of all wines and spirits businesses in Bahati, Nakuru County.  High Court Judge Hillary Chemitei said the oral directive by Natembeya will operate to the extent that business owners of bars, wines and spirits businesses operate in compliance with the Law.  "It is hereby ordered that there be a stay order of the said oral directive by the respondent (Natembeya)," ruled Justice Chemitei.  The judge said nothing barred Natembeya or any other agencies from monitoring and supervising the wines and spirits to ensure compliance with the law.    Government officers suspended after death of 10 said to have consumed illicit brew  Crackdown on illicit brews unearths hidden stash as more die  Death toll in Bahati poisoned liquor tragedy rises to 8  Standoff at Nakuru college over suspended exams  In a suit, Nakuru North Bars and Wines Association chairman Alex Kangethe said the businesses complied with all the relevant laws and were operating smoothly until August 12, 2021, when Natembeya suspended operations.  The closure followed the death of at least 10 people after consuming illicit brew.  Kangethe said the declaration was unconstitutional, unprocedural, unreasonable, and against the rules and tenets of natural justice.  "The wines and spirit businesses are a source of employment for several people in Bahati and its environs," he said.
