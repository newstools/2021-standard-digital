Jubilee headquarters, Nairobi. [Boniface Okendo, Standard]  Two residents have moved to court seeking to revoke the nomination of Felistus Wanjiku by Jubilee Party MCA to the Kiambu County Assembly.  Joseph Muchai and Joyce Gachie accused the party of shortchanging Serah Thuku, who they said, was supposed to take the position left vacant by Yvonne Waweru who resigned in January.  The petitioners, through a certificate of urgency, claim Thuku was supposed to be the automatic Jubilee nominee as per the party's laws.  Kiambu County Assembly in session.

Kiambu County Assembly speaker, Jubilee Party and Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) chairman Wafula Chebukati have been listed as respondents in the suit.  Wanjiku was sworn into office on Tuesday as a specially elected MCA by speaker Stephen Ndichu.
