The Government must do everything to stop the smuggling of sugar from neighbouring countries, which seems to be thriving.  In the latest incident, police impounded more than 400 bags of contraband sugar last Thursday in western Kenya. On September 3, KRA officers seized 230 bags suspected of smuggled sugar along the Nakuru-Nairobi highway.  This illegal business must be brought to an end. Besides denying the Government the much-needed revenue, it also contributes to the stifling of the local sugar industry. Smuggling and uncontrolled importation of cheap sugar deals a blow not only to the industries but also to farmers whose only source of income is sugarcane farming.  Authorities must deal ruthlessly with smugglers and its officials who look the other way while illegal goods are being sneaked into the country.   Why reviving debt-ridden Uchumi and Mumias Sugar remains a tall order  Police seize 400 bags of contraband sugar  Bongo princess Zuchu in footsteps of her mother  How death of Mumias Sugar killed the once vibrant Shibale  Dr. Mukhisa Kituyi's take on the war between the Executive vs Judiciary & the troubled Mumias  Leasing process to be taken to salvage the troubled Mumias Sugar company  Bitter Sugar Wars: Local leaders trade accusations as the row over Mumias Sugar Company continues By Editorial | 12 hours ago By Editorial | 1 day ago By Editorial | 2 days ago By Editorial | 5 days ago
