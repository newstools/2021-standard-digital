His body was taken to the Montezuma Monalisa Funeral Home on Mbagathi Way.  Funeral plans are underway, Francis said.  In April 2019, Odipo suffered another stroke that left him paralysed.  In January 2021, however, his health improved, and doctors were optimistic that he would recover.  Odipo served as a columnist and business editor for The Standard newspaper in the early 2000s.
