[File, Standard]  A 50-year-old woman from Kilungu in Makueni County collapsed and died on Wednesday, September 15, while reporting her “stubborn” daughter to police.  Consolata Mutua died at the Salama Police Station, where she had dragged her daughter, whom she accused of “bad behaviour”.  According to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), Mutua alleged that her teenage child had “tormented” her by not returning home during school holidays.  “As she begged our officers to intervene so that her daughter mends her ways, she became emotionally overwhelmed and collapsed. Police officers and a well-wisher tried to administer first aid to no avail,” said the DCI in a statement on Twitter on Thursday, September 16.  Traders counting losses 2 weeks after cancelled governors meeting  Makueni County: For Sh500 yearly, all treatment, even surgeries are free  Devolution Conference postponed  Hoteliers eye more business as devolution conference nears Mutua was taken to the Kilungu Sub-County Hospital, where she died while receiving treatment.
