Taita Taveta MCAs are seeking divine intervention following the death of yet another of their colleagues last week.   Mahoo MCA Ronald Sagurani succumbed to Covid-19 and was buried last weekend.  At the time of his death, the former Mahoo MP was serving his second term in office.  So far, four MCAs have died in the county since the 2017 elections.    MCAs in mad rush for post-graduate degrees  MCAs seek to review cooperatives law to revive coffee sector  Health gets largest share as Kirinyaga MCAs approve Sh6.6 billion budget  Taita Taveta MCA Ronald Sagurani dies In December 2019, ODM MCA Anastanzia Wakesho Mombo died. She was battling breast cancer for nearly four years.  Last year, Wundnyi-Mbale Ward Rep Beatrice Mwabili, the only female elected MCA in the 2017 elections, succumbed to cancer.  And in April this year, ODM nominated MCA Joyce Mwangoji died of Covid-19.  Yesterday, while eulogising their departed colleagues, MCAs called for divine intervention.  Mboghoni ward representative Jones Maskuji will replace Sagurani as Minority Leader in the Assembly.  "It is a sad day as darkness has come to this House again," said MCA Frank Mmare.     CAF to file challenge to requirement of MPs and MCA’s positions to have a university degree in 2022  Wakazi Kajiado wahimizwa kula matunda, Ukataji miti Taita Taveta, Yuko wapi Nkatha? | MBIU YA KTN  Wajir MCAs to push for their case for the removal of Governor Mohamed Abdi Mohamud, by impeachment By Patrick Beja | 40 minutes ago By Bernard Sanga and Patrick Beja | 1 day ago By Patrick Beja | 2 days ago By Philip Mwakio | 2 days ago
