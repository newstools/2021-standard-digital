Lucy Wairimu, a Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) candidate at Gathanji Primary School, is the second pupil to die in similar circumstances at the institution in the last two years.  Monica Wanjiku, an aunt, said she saw her walking home at around 7am. When she arrived, she did her assignments as ordered and requested her mother to accompany her to school.
