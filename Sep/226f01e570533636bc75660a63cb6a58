[Collins Kweyu, Standard]  Four police officers and a civilian charged with the murder of lawyer Willie Kimani have been put on their defense after High Court Judge Jessie Lessit today ruled they have a case to answer.  Willie Kimani, his client Josphat Mwenda and their driver Joseph Muiruri were abducted on June 23, 2016 shortly after leaving Mavoko Law Courts, Athi River, where they were pursuing a case against the police.   The three victims were reportedly driven to their deaths at 7pm in a thicket in Mlolongo, in a Nissan Wingroad belonging to a police officer.  A team of investigators including those from USA’s Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) said the three were bludgeoned at an open field a few meters away from an AP camp where they had been held for hours.  Used syringes, empty drug bottles found in dead children's bedroom  Fifteen counties where women have become more dangerous  21-year-old man kills two women in hit-and-run accident  Police holding Nakuru doctor after his two children aged 3 and 5 found dead The three bodies were then stuffed into gunny bags and dumped at to Ol-Donyo Sabuk River, almost 70 kilometres away from the crime scene.
