The National Assembly Justice and Legal Affairs Committee (JLAC) had yesterday approved the names of all four nominees.  They will fill the vacant positions left after the resignation of Roselyn Akombe, Margaret Mwachanya, Paul Kurgat, and Connie Maina.  Their appointment now means that the electoral agency is fully constituted after three years of operating with just the chairman and two commissioners.  It also sets the pace for IEBC to fully prepare for the 2022 General Election, putting to rest the question of quorum.
