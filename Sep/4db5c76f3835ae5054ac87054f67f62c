Rift Valley Regional Commissioner George Natembeya faulted elected leaders in Trans Nzoia for failing to provide solutions to what is ailing the county.  Natembeya cited lack of title deeds and neglect of needy children as major issues in the county. He said 80 per cent of the residents lack title deeds for the land they occupy, while local MPs had failed to petition parliament.  He spoke when Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa handed two-block title deeds for two farms in the area. Natembeya criticised leaders for allocating too little funds to fund bursaries for poor students.  “How can you issue Sh2,000 as a bursary to pupils from vulnerable families? Is this money meant for fees or pocket money? This is a big joke,” he said.    School in Trans Nzoia on the spot   Laikipia insecurity: Eight killed in a month  Court lifts order by Natembeya to shut bars, liquor stores in Bahati  Man in Trans Nzoia held for forcing daughter to drop out of school  Morning Express Sports Chat 9th May 2016 Trans Nzoia Sports Association  Mwanamke Ngangari: Seneta mteule Bi.
