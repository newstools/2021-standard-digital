It is now clear that teachers may have to wait for four years to enjoy enhanced salaries as the employer seals any hopes for review.   In a circular released to guide implementation of the 2021-2025 CBA, Teachers Service Commission (TSC) guidelines on new Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) affirmed that tutors will continue to enjoy old salary rates.   Even the allowances will be laid based on old rates as has been the case under the just ended Sh56 billion CBA which pushed teachers’ pay higher.   However, TSC Chief Executive Nancy Macharia says teachers will enjoy enhanced leave days and flexible transfers that would help bring closer families that had been separated by distance.   “To achieve the family values enshrined in the constitution, the commission shall consider transfer requests for married couples to appropriate stations/locations subject to availability of vacancies, the need for suitable replacement, existing staffing norms and proof of marriage among other factors,” a circular by Macharia says.  TSC all set to roll out new refresher courses  TVET lecturers want council set up to take care of salaries  Youngster Mumbi wins NCBA Golf Series in Limuru  House watchdog probes KPA overtime payments The CBA was signed between the commission and three unions; Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT), Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (KUPPET) and Kenya Union of Special Needs Education Teachers (KUSNET) on July 13, 2021.  It will run up to June 30 2025. At the time CBA was signed, the unions said that they had agreed that TSC would revisit the salary component, in July.  The circular by Macharia seemed to shut down that door.
