Kajiado Governor Joseph ole Lenku has blamed former Finance Department officials for failing to cooperate with auditors.  The Senate's County Public Accounts and Investment committee yesterday put Lenku to task to explain why officials did not avail crucial documents for audit.  "We cannot understand why these documents were not availed at the right time, yet they seem to have been in order. You were let down by your officers. In fact do you know that an elephant is brought down by very small things," said the committee chairman Ochillo Ayako (Migori).  Lenku, however, said he has since sent home some of the officials and reshuffled others. "I was forced to take administrative action against the former Finance  Executive Alais Kisota and Chief Finance Officer Sankaire Tima for errors of omission and poor engagement with the county's external stakeholders," he said.    Moving on: Kianjakoma and Kajiado families’ pain  How dormitories act as forts against harmful practices  Shock as mother, three children and house help killed in night inferno  23-year-old househelp stranded in Abu Dhabi finally returns home The governor then appointed Michael Semera, a former manager at Equity Bank, and Lekina Tutui.
