[Omondi Onyango, Standard]  A Cabinet secretary has warned youth against falling prey to leaders who want to use them to ascend to power by giving them false hope.  Information and Communication Technology Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru equated the leaders with colonialists who used the Bible and the gun to take away African’s wealth.   “They grabbed land by creating fear that it was only the meek, weak, and poor who will go to heaven.”    Anxiety as wildlife attacks in Naivasha intensify  ACK to bar clergy from meeting politicians, Sapit says  It’s race against time as parties set up offices to woo Mt Kenya voters  Why Mount Kenya region is the darling of 2022 presidential aspirants Mucheru said the youth should be wary of leaders who want to use them by promising them what is not workable.  Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho who accompanied the Cabinet secretary dismissed the bottom-up economic model backed by Deputy President William Ruto as an idea meant to confuse the youth.  The two leaders were speaking at Swahili Pot in Mombasa County during a youth meeting on Sunday.  The Cabinet secretary claimed Kenyans were being cheated a second time as the campaigns for the 2022 General Election enter the homestretch, noting the poor masses could easily be cheated through false promises from politicians.  Governor Joho insisted Kenyans were not consulted about the bottom-up economic model for them to interrogate it “before it was pushed down their throats”.    Exploring the preparedness and the key timeliness of the IEBC to conduct the 2022 General Elections  Mercy Kipchumba & Victor Kipchirchir are the winners of the 3rd edition of the Eldoret City marathon  Mercy Kipchumba na Victor Kipchirchir waibuka washindi katika Eldoret City Marathon By Jacob Ng’etich and Grace Ng’ang’a | 6 hours ago By George Njunge | 13 hours ago By Jacob Ng’etich | 14 hours ago By Jacob Ng’etich | 14 hours ago
