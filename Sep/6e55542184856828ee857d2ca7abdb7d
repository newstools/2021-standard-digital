Members of the Technical Working Group on harmonisation of Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) qualifications are meeting in Nairobi and virtually to discuss the draft Regional TVET Qualification Framework.  This framework will reduce incidences of time spent by trainees to re-learn in order to reach outcomes expected in other contexts, as well as boost independence in decision making.  The workshop organised by the Inter-University Council for East Africa, through the EASTRIP project, is an initiative of African governments and the World Bank to increase access and improve the quality of TVET programmes in selected institutions.  While officiating the three-day workshop that will culminate in the validation of the harmonised TVET qualifications framework, the Principal Secretary Ministry of Education, State Department of TVET Margaret Mwakima reiterated the crucial opportunities presented by the advancement of the regional TVET agenda.     Why varsities, colleges lost out on trainings  Magoha must apply better methods to keep all learners in class  Fund private TVETs better to offer skills for future workforce  TVET lecturers want council set up to take care of salaries “Good quality education and training system in the region is a pathway for employment and entrepreneurship, which is in line with the Sustainable Development Goal Number 4,” she said.  Her sentiments were shared by the IUCEA Executive Secretary Prof Gaspard Banyankimbona who noted that “the harmonisation of TVET qualifications will support regional integration by facilitating free movement of skilled labour and professional services.”   Ukarabati wa TVET, Mimba za mapema Kajiado, Ukosefu wa Ajira Taita Taveta, | Mbiu Ya KTN | 2  Safe reopening of TVETs guaranteed, over 3,000 to be examined in January  Vyuo vya TVET vitafunguliwa baada ya kufungwa kutokana na Covid-19 By Winfrey Owino | 1 hour ago By Grace Ng'ang'a | 2 hours ago By Grace Ng’ang’a | 7 hours ago By Amos Kareithi | 8 hours ago
