Only 2,000 guests will be allowed to attend this year's Mashujaa Day celebrations on October 20 at the Wang’uru Stadium in Mwea, Kirinyaga County.  Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho said the number has been reduced from 15,000 to 2,000 due to Covid-19 threat. Speaking at General Kassam Stadium in Kianyaga in Gichugu Constituency during a leaders' meeting, Kibicho said President Uhuru Kenyatta will be the guest of honour during the celebration to be attended by other heads of state and dignitaries.  On September 14, Kirinyaga leaders held their first meeting at Kutus Sifa Garden and agreed to shelve their differences for the success of the fete.  “During our first meeting at Kutus, we brought together former and elected leaders and updated them on development undertaken by the national government,” Roads PS Paul Maringa said.     Karanja Kibicho: We’ll not listen to insults from DP Ruto allies  Matiang'i: Ruto has biggest security detail in history  State trains its guns on agents who import fake merchandise  DP William Ruto lacked 'necessary' papers, says Kibicho Kibicho said leaders will continue with meetings before and after Mashujaa Day celebrations for unity purposes.
