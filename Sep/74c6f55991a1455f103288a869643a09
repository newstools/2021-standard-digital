A group of women in Narok invaded a pub and destroyed property to protest the sale of illicit brew following the death of a 20-year-old man.  The women destroyed TV sets and removed all seats from the pub in Olerai trading centre before setting them ablaze.  They complained that their men and the youth had been consuming illicit brew in the den for a while, leading to increased family feuds.  “We are tired of seeing our men and sons drinking uncontrollably here. The other day one was found dead inside the bar,” lamented Millicent Kamwaro.    Farmer who sold Sh1 million bull to Uhuru quits dairy farming  Boys burn dorm after being barred from church service  Court lifts order by Natembeya to shut bars, liquor stores in Bahati  Governor Tunai declares he will run for senate seat in 2022 The women, who demonstrated along the Narok-Bomet road, were later dispersed by police.  Area Sub-County Police Commander Frederick Shiundu condemned the move by the women to "take the law into their own hands".  “We have heard your cries and we shall take appropriate action. But don't wait until such incidences happen for you to take action,” he said.   Town MCA Benard Torome appealed to the county government to fight illicit brew sale locally.
