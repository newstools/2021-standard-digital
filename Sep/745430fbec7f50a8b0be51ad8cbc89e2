Police have arrested four suspects from a neighbouring country on suspicion they were smuggling two lorries transporting stolen motorbikes to Moyale town, Marsabit County.  The arrest comes days after police raided a garage in Eastleigh last Sunday and found 25 motorbikes.  According to Maurice Nyangao, the chief executive officer of Hi-Line Motors Ltd, which deals in motorbikes, they used trackers to trace one of the stolen motorcycles.    “We saw on the tracking system the motorbike was moving towards Thika in a truck and we called the multi-agency team. Within one hour, it was at Kenol, Murang’a County, and it’s here that we knew the destination was northern Kenya. Police set up a roadblock at Isiolo and Nanyuki, and between Isiolo and Moyale,’’ said Nyangao, whose company lost seven new motorbikes last month.  Blast kills two children in Isiolo, ex-councillor shot dead  Winding road trip down to scenic Isiolo  Nairobi county to auction 193 unclaimed motorbikes  Twelve counties in dire need of relief food as drought worsens The arrest was made at 12am at Nanyuki.    Mashindano ya WRC yakamilika, Washukiwa wakuu wa Utekaji wakamatwa, Mapigano Isiolo | MBIU WIKENDI  Tension high along Isiolo-Samburu border following clashes between rival herders from two counties  Isiolo Killings: 5 people killed and scores injured in a night attack in Madowale village, Isiolo By Caroline Chebet | 16 hours ago By Kamau Muthoni | 1 day ago By Jacob Ng'etich | 9 days ago By Ali Abdi | 11 days ago
