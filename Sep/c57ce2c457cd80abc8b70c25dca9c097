Crime scene. [File]  Police have confirmed that a 17-year-old boy who died in Huruma, Nairobi on Thursday night, September 9, succumbed to injuries inflicted by a bullet fired by DCI officers.  Authorities say Haila Asanake died after being hit by a stray bullet fired by DCI detectives, who were repulsing residents’ hostility.  Asanake’s family says the teenager was standing on a balcony at their Kiamaiko home at around 8pm, when the bullet fatally struck him.  Police now say DCI detectives attached to Pangani post had stopped a suspicious motor vehicle, and when the driver of the car alighted, he “started a scuffle with the detectives”.  Rights group decries police brutality in Embu  DP William Ruto hits out at police boss for 'neglecting his duties'  Thika residents lynch man who killed his wife, left four-month-old baby in a car  Viral picture of woman hanging precariously on fence not Omanga’s The resultant melee, police say, attracted other members of the public, who reacted by stoning the detectives.  “This prompted officers to shoot in the air,” says a police report filed at the Huruma Police Station under the OB Number 70/09/09/2021.  Asanake, who was allegedly killed by the fired bullet, died on arrival at the Jumuia Hospital.

His body is still preserved at the same facility, awaiting postmortem.
