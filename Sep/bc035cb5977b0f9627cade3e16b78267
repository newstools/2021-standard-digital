In the industrial economy, we have a labour force. Likewise, in the service sector, we have new technologies and the biggest asset will be human capital which will be a combination of talent, skill and creativity,” said Manoj Sinha  “While making the growth model we have to be careful to ensure increase in human capital.  According to me, the education sector should also compete with the rest of the country,” Sinha added.  Galwan Valley clash took ties with China in different direction: India foreign minister Jaishankar  Canada: Indian diaspora in Vancouver protests against NDP leader Jagmeet Singh   Parliamentary Standing Committee on health begins 3-day study tour of Jammu and Kashmir   Jammu and Kashmir: Cleaning drive organised to preserve Dal Lake “I would also mention that along with TATA groups (Indian multi-national company) we have set up two centres for innovation, invention and incubation in Baramula, Jammu.
