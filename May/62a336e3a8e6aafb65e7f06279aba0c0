A Nairobi church has protested a move by a private developer to lock them from accessing their place of worship yesterday.  Mwangaza Ministries, at Muoroto in Dagoretti, claim they arrived for Sunday service only to find the area where the church stands had been fenced off.  The church’s founder Lucy Wairimu said they were caught them unawares since the developer had not issued them with any notice to vacate before fencing off the land.  "We have been worshipping here since 2001 after being allowed to erect a church and in 2003. The local administration is aware because this is government property,” said Wairimu.  However, the developer claims that she applied for the land in 1991 and the paperwork was completed in 2018.  Why you could pay Sh1,000 to use Rironi-Mau Summit road  Environmentalists push drive on waste collection in Nairobi estates  Safarilink, Governor Joho in tiff over missed flight to Nairobi  Lessons on public transport that Nairobi can learn from other cities “The church was aware but they did not take any action, in fact, the church is now on the wrong for breaking into my property, ” stated Janet Ndirangu, who claims the ownership of the land.     Take a quick survey and help us improve our website!
