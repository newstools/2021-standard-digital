County Commissioner Amos Mariba who confirmed the incident said the man identified as James Mong'are Orucho is suspected to have strangled his 95-year old mother, Catherine Moraa, for reasons still being investigated.  Mariba said the granny was found in her bed at around 6 am on Sunday with visible scars on her body.  "Police officers from Nyamira North visited the scene and established that the deceased had bruises on her face and blood was oozing from her nose," Nyamira North sub-county police Commander Patrick Ngeiywa said.
