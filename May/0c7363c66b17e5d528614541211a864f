The Government has initiated two programmes worth Sh25 billion for aquaculture development.  Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya said the initiative was targeted at ensuring increased efficiency and profitability of at least 300,000 small-scale fish farmers countrywide.  In a speech read on his behalf by Agriculture CAS Lawrence Omuhaka during the National Aquaculture Day at Fisheries grounds in Busia on Thursday, the CS said the government was committed to making fish farming a vibrant economic activity.  “The collapse of Economic Stimulus initiative left a number of issues unaddressed. The new programmes will enhance production, value addition, marketing and consumption of fish and fishery products,” Munya said.  The two projects are the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Socio-Economic Development Programme (KMFSEDP) worth Sh10 billion, and Aquaculture Business Development Programme.  How to reap handsome returns by keeping tilapia in your backyard  Counties out to lease factories as clients keep off pond fish  Why donkey meat could soon be on your plate  Tea prices dip 12 per cent on glut KMFSEDP will be implemented over five years jointly by government and the World Bank in 19 sub-counties, and 98 wards in Kwale, Mombasa, Kilifi, Tana River and Lamu.  “It aims to support the country in its efforts to leverage emerging opportunities in the Blue Economy, with the overall goal of improving management of priority fisheries and mariculture and increasing access to complementary livelihood activities in coastal communities,” said Omuhaka.   Take a quick survey and help us improve our website!
