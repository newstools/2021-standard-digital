This increase was due to the issuance of a bond by Centum Investment’s subsidiary Centum Real Estate Limited to raise Sh4 Billion with a Green Shoe Option of Sh2 billion.  The proceeds raised from the bond will be used to finance the different housing projects that the company is engaging in.   In the secondary bond market, the quarter one 2021 bond market turnover increased by 17.80 per cent with Sh199.38 billion worth of bonds traded compared to Sh169.26 billion traded in the fourth quarter of 2020.
