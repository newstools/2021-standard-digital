The Kenya Bureau of Standards (Kebs) has adopted five new standards to boost the safety and quality of food additives in the market.  Kebs Managing Director Bernard Njiraini said the approved standards will provide a basis to ascertain the quality, purity and safety of the food additives as guided by General Standard for Food additives.  “The use of food additives in food processing is technologically unavoidable," he said, noting that the move will facilitate trade while ensuring safe and sufficient food for a growing economy.  The new standards provide the criteria to determine the purity, safety and quality parameters for bakers’ yeast, sucralose, aspartame, saccharin and baking powder.   State agency blunders to cost taxpayers over Sh1tr in piling lawsuits  KRA raises alarm over fake vehicle registration numbers  New guidelines for production of packaging paper  Kebs flags down three substandard face mask brands  A total of 385 brands of alcohol suspended by Kenya Bureau of Standards   Fertilizer scam as parliamentary Committee on Agricultures probes fertilizer into the market.
