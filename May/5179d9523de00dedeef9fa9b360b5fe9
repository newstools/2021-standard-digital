Five suspected terrorists were on Sunday arrested in Kisumu County.  Nyando sub-county police boss Leonard Matete said three of the suspects were arrested in Ahero while two others were nabbed in Kombewa.  “The three suspects had boarded a matatu heading to Kericho but alighted in Ahero when they realized they were being tracked. They started walking back towards Kisumu after they learned that a police roadblock had been erected near Ahero,” Matete said.  The police boss revealed that the suspects had Pakistan passports and appeared to have been in the country for a long period of time.  According to Matete, the suspects were being tracked by the Anti-Terror Police Unit following their suspicious activities and have been handed over to the unit for interrogation.  Mombasa struggles to stay afloat amid beaten nightlife  Ethiopia declares Tigray's TPLF, Shene terrorist groups  Man killed by crocodile in Lake Victoria, another survives attack  In pictures: When a 40-tonner smashes saloons     Changes in Kisumu: Land court to make a determination on county's directive of banning burials in CB  Shot In The Arm: Kisumu County set to roll out Covid-19 vaccination exercise  New Look Kisumu: Personal cars banned from parking along Oginga Odinga street, order given by county By James Omoro | 8 hours ago By Olivia Odhiambo | 1 day ago By Mactilda Mbenywe and Collins Oduor | 1 day ago By By Harold Odhiambo | 1 day ago Read The Standard uninterrupted with no advertisements
