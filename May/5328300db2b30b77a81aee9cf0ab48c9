Gaza's Islamist ruler Hamas said it had fired over 130 rockets towards Tel Aviv on Tuesday night in response to an Israeli air strike that had flattened a tower block in the Strip.  Sirens warning of incoming rocket fire blared in Tel Aviv and central Israel on Tuesday night, Reuters witnesses said.  The sounds of multiple explosions were also heard, just minutes after Gaza militants Hamas and Islamic Jihad vowed to respond to an Israeli air strike on a residential tower in the Strip earlier in the night.  "We are carrying (out) now our promise (by) launching a massive rocket strike against Tel Aviv and its suburbs, with 130 rockets, in response to the enemy's targeting of residential towers,” Hamas's armed wing said in a statement.    Senior Hamas commander killed as Israel strikes Gaza  35 killed in Gaza, 5 in Israel, as violence escalates  Gaza block collapses after Israeli strike, rockets hit Tel Aviv  Human Rights Watch accuses Israel of 'apartheid' crimes against Palestinians  Mama apatikana hai katika mafuriko wa jengo la Huruma  Rongai rocket man aiming to build Kenya’s first locally-made rocket  President Uhuru Kenyatta arrives in Tel Aviv, Israel for a state visit By Reuters | 1 hour ago By Reuters | 3 hours ago By Reuters | 4 hours ago By Betty Njeru | 6 hours ago It’s business as usual for Isaac Mwaura despite axing from Senate
