Residents of Rurii ward in Nyandarua County are currently casting their votes amid claims of police intimidation.  Residents have accused police of erecting roadblocks and barring them from accessing voting areas.  "We have seen roadblocks everywhere and that is why we think people are shying away from voting. Only a few people have voted so far" complained MP Faith Gitau.  She wondered why police were vetting residents on every entry point to the ward.  Three candidates are vying for the seat, including Muraya Githaiga (UDA) Peter Thinji (Jubilee) and Susan Wangeci of the New Democrats of Kenya party.  Voting in Juja, Bonchari by-elections underway   Nyandarua County Assembly Speaker impeached for third time  My life is in danger, claims reinstated speaker  Wahome cries foul as Nyandarua Assembly’s mace disappears Media was barred from accessing polling centres with the returning officer Agnes Wanjiku ordering media out of the Rurii Polytechnic polling station.
