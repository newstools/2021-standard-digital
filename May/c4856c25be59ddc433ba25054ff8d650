A ship stalled at the Likoni Channel, blocking ferry operations that serve hundreds of pedestrians and vehicles per day.  The vessel, which is more than 200 metres long, developed a mechanical problem, according to the Kenya Ferry Services.  The Cyprian flagged ship had just left the Base Titanium terminal when it stalled a few metres away.  Ferries had to use longer routes to manoeuvre their way across the channel. Two Kenya Ports Authority salvage tugboats towed the ship to the Base Titanium ram.    Giant ship stalls, blocks Likoni ferry channel   Gang banned years ago returns to Likoni bridge   Traders fear ferry channel could be coronavirus weak link  New measures for Likoni ferry users  HANGAIKO LIKONI: Kukosekana kwa ferry kwatatiza usafiri mjini Mombasa  11 people including school children injured in stampede at Likoni Ferry  Challenges at Likoni Ferry as disorder linked to high number of people failing to maintain order By Obare Osinde | 6 hours ago By Patrick Beja | 1 day ago By Weldon Kipkemoi | 1 day ago By Philip Mwakio | 1 day ago Uhuru unveils major plans for Nyanza ahead of visit
