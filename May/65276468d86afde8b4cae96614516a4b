The EU-funded programme that started in April 2020 will run for four years.  The programme aims at increasing Kenya's contribution of the horticultural sector to household income through employment opportunities and foreign currencies. It comes after the sector incurred a net loss of Sh8 billion in March 2020, as a result of the adverse effects of Covid-19.  EU Deputy Head of Delegation Katrin Hagemann said at a virtual meeting on Thursday the bloc would ensure Kenya’s horticultural exports' compliance with sanitary and phytosanitary standards.   EU carbon price hits record above 50 euros per tonne  EAC, EU to align development priorities for next six years  Uhuru roots for more trade deals within OACPS  Makueni mango eyes EU market  UHURU IN GERMANY; President Uhuru Kenyatta wants AMISON elevated to UN  UHURU IN GERMANY; President Uhuru Kenyatta wants AMISON elevated to UN  UHURU IN GERMANY; President Uhuru Kenyatta wants AMISON elevated to UN By Fredrick Obura | 12 hours ago By Reuters | 14 hours ago By James Wanzala | 16 hours ago By Reuters | 17 hours ago Uhuru Kenyatta changes tune on purge against DP William Ruto allies
