High Court has ordered a prime suspect in the murder of former acting communications director at National Land Commission (NLC) officer Jennifer Wambua to undergo a mental test.  High Court judge, Justice David Kimei said the mental assessment is to ascertain whether Peter Mwangi Njenga alias Sankale is fit to stand trial.  The judge also forwarded Sankale’s case file to Kajiado High Court where the suspect will appear for plea taking on May 26.  The suspect, whom police describe as a serial killer is to be remanded at Kajiado GK Prison until the said date.  The charge against Sankale states that "between March 12 and 13, 2021 at Veterinary Farm-Ebulbul in Kajiado North Sub County, jointly with others not before the court, murdered Jennifer Itumbi Wambua."  Key suspect in Jennifer Wambua murder case to take mental test  NLC signs deal on groups land  Third suspect in journalist Jennifer Wambua murder detained  Suspects in Jennifer Wambua's murder detained for 10 more days The suspect was driven to Machakos for arraignment after it turned out that there was no judge available in Kajiado High Court to deal with the matter.
