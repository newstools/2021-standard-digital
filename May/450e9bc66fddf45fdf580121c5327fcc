Kisumu Governor Anyang Nyong'o says Madaraka Day celebration will go on in Kisumu on June 1 despite spike in Covid-19 cases in the county.  "We can't postpone the celebration. We have discussed this matter with the National Celebration Committee and agreed that the celebration will go on as planned," said Prof Nyong'o.  The governor was responding to calls by a section of local residents who want the celebration to be moved to another county following increased Covid-19 cases in the lakeside region.  On Wednesday, Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho said only 3,000 people will be allowed into the Jomo Kenyatta International Stadium in Kisumu where the national celebration will be held.  About 20,000 people will follow the celebration on big screens at Kirembe and Prophet David Owuor grounds and in Kisumu.  Kenya runs out of Covid-19 vaccines as fourth wave predicted in June  Looming Covid-19 peak raises concerns over school calendar  Kenya has run out of Covid-19 vaccines, CS Kagwe admits  Covid-19: Kenya records 494 new cases, five deaths in last 24 hours "What we expect is for people to wear face masks, keep social distancing and obey all health safety protocols spelt out by the Ministry of Health.
