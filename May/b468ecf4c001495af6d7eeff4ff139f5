Police recovered four bodies of the Kibra flood victims on Friday morning, May 14, 2021. [Standard]  Four people drowned in Kibra floods on Thursday night.  The four, who hail from Lindi Village in the Nairobi slum, were swept away by floods that deluged the area.  Three of the four have been identified as male boda boda riders, who operated from Jonathan Ng’eno Estate in Lang’ata.  Police had a torrid time collecting the bodies as residents accused the law enforcement officers of doing little to retrieve the bodies in time.  The residents carried two of the bodies with them Friday morning, but later surrendered the remains to the cops.  The deceased were taken to City Mortuary.  A parent of one of the deceased told The Standard that his son was returning home, when he was swept away by the raging waters.
