The County Assembly of Nyeri has voted to approve Governor Mutahi Kahiga's nominee to chair the county health service fund board.  In approving the nomination of Antony Mithanga, the MCAs unanimously agreed the businessman had the right credentials.  In its report which was tabled in the plenary before being put to a vote by the assembly, the Health committee had given Mithanga a clean bill after he scored 91 per cent.  “The committee has found the nominee's integrity and ability unquestionable and thus fit to handle the position he is nominated to. We  unanimously recommend,” the committee chaired by Joseph Nderitu added.  The board will manage user fees payable at all health facilities in the county and insurance premiums collected from members.  Patients hard hit by county cash crunch  Nyeri: Four killed, two injured in head-on collision  State fails to stop release of businessman accused of murdering son   We live in fear: ‘Haunted village’ near State lodge  The main objective of the money is to improve services and ensure the facilities have better access to financial resources as contained in Nyeri County Health Services Bill, 2020.  The committee, however, said Mithanga should cease being a member and chairperson of the Nyeri County Referral Hospital once he assumes the new position.
