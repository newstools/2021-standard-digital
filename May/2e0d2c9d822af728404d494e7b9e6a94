South Sudan's President Salva Kiir has dissolved parliament, a long-awaited step to pave the way for the appointment of lawmakers from formerly warring parties in the country.  The move was in line with a peace deal signed to end a civil war that began in 2013.  The president dissolved parliament on Saturday and the new body will be formed in "a matter of time, not too long", his spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny told Reuters.  According to the deal that ended the civil war, parliament must be expanded from 400 members to 550 and must include members from all parties to the peace accord.  South Sudan won independence from Sudan in 2011 after decades of civil war. Violence erupted in late 2013 after Kiir, from the Dinka ethnic group, sacked vice president Riek Machar, a Nuer.  Hope to save lost white rhinos hangs on IVF  Dreadful search and 26-hour drive with friend's burnt body  High cost of living is foreign students’ biggest concern - survey reveals  Long-distance truck drivers lament insecurity cases The two men have signed many deals to end a war estimated to have killed more than 400,000 people.
