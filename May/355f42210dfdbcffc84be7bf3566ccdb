The High Court has stopped the Nyamira County Assembly from vetting Deputy Governor nominee James Gesami for the post.  Gesami will not be vetted for a second time even after Governor Amos Nyaribo mended his relationship with the County Assembly.  Most MCAs have been an impediment in Gesami's nomination but a month ago, Nyaribo mooted an agreement with them to allow him nominate the former West Mugirango MP.  However, a resident moved to court to bar the former MP from being subjected to fresh vetting.     Rescue efforts on following collapse of county building in Nyamira  Battle lines drawn in Nyamira as Nyaribo nominates Gesami for deputy  Class seven pupil in Nyamira stabs classmate to death over a pen  Road that has made and destroyed political careers for three decades     Maiti yafukuliwa kisii baada ya mahakama kutoa agizo  Man kills wife and chops body parts in Nyamira County  Mke apatikana na makosa ya uzinzi mjini Nyamira By Kepher Otieno | 2 hours ago By Robert Amalemba | 1 day ago By Allan Mungai | 1 day ago By Stanley Ongwae | 4 days ago Uhuru unveils major plans for Nyanza ahead of visit
