The county government of Kajiado yesterday denied having enacted new land regulations, in response to a public notice that is currently making rounds online, and which has caused disquiet among investors and land owners.  In a letter sent to media houses and signed by the county CECM in charge of Lands, Physical Planning, Housing, Urban Development and Municipalities Hamilton Parseina, the notice alleging that the county has introduced new land regulations targeting land subdivision is fake.  “This information is fake and is being circulated by enemies of progress in Kajiado County. We, therefore, urge investors and members of the public to ignore the said fake notice,” the letter read in part.    Counties sign to donate 73,000 acres for Konza urban development  Couple, 1-year-old daughter survive Isinya crash     Over 60,000 residents in Kajiado County to benefit from the Oloitoktok water and Sewerage project   Isaac Ruto joins CORD in push for the disbandment of IEBC  Wakaazi wa Kajiado waghadhabishwa na hatua ya wawakilishi wadi kusususia hotuba ya gavana Nkedianye By Philip Muasya | 5 hours ago By Erastus Mulwa | 5 hours ago By Mireri Junior | 1 day ago By Gerald Mutethia | 1 day ago
