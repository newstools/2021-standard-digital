NAIROBI, KENYA: Economic survey report will not be released on time, Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) has said.  In a notice, KNBS says the delay has been occasioned by the late submission of necessary data by respondents for the compilation of the report as a result of Covid-19 related challenges.  “The report will be disseminated at the earliest opportunity once the process is completed,” said Macdonald Obudho, Director General, Kenya National Bureau of Statistics.  The Economic Survey report is an annual publication prepared by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics that provides socio-economic information covering five years.  The statistics are based on a wide variety of sources including own surveys and censuses, studies carried out by other institutions and administrative data collected by ministries, departments and agencies, county governments, and establishments.  President Uhuru assents to the Division of Revenue Bill, 2021  Sustainable job creation by youths can boost economy  Property developers shy away from new projects in Nairobi  Tour industry asks State for bailout amid travel ban The report is normally released ahead of the national budget speech read in June by the Treasury cabinet secretary.     KNBStatistics data shows that cost of living fall 6.02 per cent, from 6.09 per cent in November 2014  CS Yatani says tax measures need to be repealed to cushion Gov't against shortfalls  Macdonald Obudho takes charge at KNBS, he takes over from Zachary Mwangi By Fredrick Obura | 25 minutes ago By Standard Reporter | 1 hour ago By Reuters | 5 hours ago By Macharia Kamau | 6 hours ago Ruto allies dismiss BBI as MPs take a vote on the Bill
