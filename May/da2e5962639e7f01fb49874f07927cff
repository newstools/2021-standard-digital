Nairobi County Government has renamed a road after workers' union boss Francis Atwoli.  Deputy Governor Anne Kananu yesterday renamed Mandera Road in Kileleshwa after the Central Organisations of Trade Unions (COTU) Secretary-General Francis Atwoli to honour the veteran unionist for his efforts in agitating for workers' rights.  "This road has been renamed after my good friend and brother bwana Francis Atwoli in recognition of his selfless contribution and agitating for the rights of Kenyan workers in the last 54 years," said Deputy Governor Anne Kananu.    Atwoli thanked Kananu's leadership for recognising his role in the trade movement and further reaffirmed his commitment to addressing the plight of Kenyan workers.  ODM de-whips seven city MCAs over Imwatok ouster  Uhuru pledges reforms to make farming lucrative  Nairobi approves Sh12b budget to settle pending bills  Nairobi MCAs root for Sh1.5 billion ward special account  "I want to thank the leadership of Nairobi under Anne Kananu, for this great honour and recognition of services to the Government of the day, the community and workers at large. We will continue offering our unwavering support to the leadership of the county," he stated.  Atwoli has now joined the list of other prominent Kenyans such as Kenneth Matiba who had Accra Road renamed after him in March 2021, Garissa Senator Yussuf Haji who had Eastleigh's First Avenue renamed after him; the late football legend Joe Kadenge who had Kapiti Crescent Road renamed after him by the county Assembly earlier this year.     Take a quick survey and help us improve our website!
