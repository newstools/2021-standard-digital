The High Court has granted reprieve to impeached Homa Bay County Health executive Prof Richard Muga.  Prof Muga was impeached by Homa Bay MCAs on May 12 over alleged abuse of office and gross violation of the Constitution.  County Assembly Deputy Speaker Ellyas Orondo tabled a motion that led to impeachment of the Health executive.  Muga later filed a petition at the Employment and Labour Relations Court in Kisumu challenging the MCAs’ action that was intended to remove him from office. In the case, Muga sued Homa Bay County Assembly and Governor Cyprian Awiti.  Justice Stephen Radido yesterday ruled that Muga should continue serving as Health executive until the case is heard and determined.  Police net bhang in abandoned car  Homa Bay KNUT officials, Sossion in fight over delegates ahead of polls  AG drops bid for judgment suspension at High Court, decides to appeal instead  By ignoring title, High Court judge disrespected President “This court grants conservatory orders staying the whole of the respondent’s action of removing the petitioner from the position of CECM for health pending hearing and determination of the application and petition filed,” Justice Radido ordered.
