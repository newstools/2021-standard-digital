The Government is set to destroy over 1,200 bags of maize which is believed to have been imported from neighbouring Tanzania.  Authorities say the maize is contaminated with aflatoxin, a naturally occurring carcinogenic chemical.  According to Migori County Commissioner Boaz Cherutich, the maize is currently at Kehancha National Cereals and Produce Board depot under tight police security.  He said they will seek a court order to allow them to destroy the contaminated maize which was sampled at the Government laboratory.  “We will seek court orders to destroy the maize which was confirmed to be contaminated with high levels of aflatoxin,” Cherutich said.  Crackdown on maize from Uganda still on  State’s raid on fuel profits causes jitters  MPs want seed and fertilizer prices lowered  Lobby protests at maize and milk imports restrictions Additionally, Cherutich noted that the Government was alarmed by the illegal importation of maize through Gukipimo centre in Makerero ward, Kuria west sub county where over 64 maize stores were closed.
