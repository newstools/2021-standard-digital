The recall covers 2016 through 2019 model year vehicles. Dealers will install push-pins and replace any damaged rail clips and roof rail covers.  The second-largest U.S. automaker said that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration first inquired about the issue in early 2020 following 11 reports of roof rail cover detachment. In April, it requested Ford issue a recall, which the carmaker had initially said was not necessary because the low likelihood of a roof rail detaching, its small weight and the fact drivers would likely detect a loose roof rail cover, according to the documents.  Ford in November said it would extend its warranty to cover the issue for 10 years or 150,000 miles before agreeing to the recall on April 30.  Tesla to recall 134,951 134,951 vehicles  Ford ordered to recall 3 million vehicles over air bags  In boost to self-driving cars, U.S. tells Google computers can qualify as drivers  In boost to self-driving cars, U.S. tells Google computers can qualify as drivers A Ford spokeswoman said Sunday the automaker is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to this condition.
