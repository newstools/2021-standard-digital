Football Kenya Federation (FKF) has announced the team that will be leading on the FKF Premier League standings by June 30 will represent Kenya in the 2021/22 CAF Champions League.  This is after a statement dated May 17, 2021, signed by FKF CEO, Barry Otieno required a name (representative) be submitted to CAF by Wednesday, June 30, 2021, which is the deadline for member associations to submit teams to its Interclub Competitions.
