United Democratic Alliance (UDA) Secretary-General Veronica Maina has downplayed ongoing internal wrangles within the ‘hustlers movement’, saying it is nothing to worry about.  The feud pits the mainstream UDA against Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria-led Peoples Empowerment Party (PEP).  Speaking in Nakuru, Maina dismissed the infighting as ‘friendly fire’, saying the movement headed by Deputy President William Ruto allows members to differ on opinion.    “These (feuds) are bound to happen since UDA and other like-minded parties are attractive and one of the best political outfits being built today,” she said on the sidelines of a leadership and aspirants meeting.  Mudavadi shares rare moment with Ruto [Photos]  Unrest in major parties as Uhuru succession nears  Kiambaa mini poll litmus test for Uhuru, Ruto  DP Ruto truce fails to stop Hustler fight     Cracks in UDA?
