A life full of tribulations has forced the children of the late Kiru Boys Principal Solomon Mwangi to plead with the court to have mercy on their mother.  From being chased away from school over fee arrears to lack of parental love, the children pleaded with the court to consider their mother's innocence.   With tears rolling down her face, June Mbuthi said she and her siblings want justice for their father whom she considered her best friend, but maintained that her mother is innocent. She asked the court to have mercy in the sentencing of her mother Jane Muthoni who was found guilty of killing her father.  The high court in April said the offence of murder had been established against Muthoni, a former Icaciri Girls Principal, and her co-accused Isaac Ng’ang’a.  Sentence Jane Muthoni to death, Prosecution urges court  After being declared guilty of murder, Jane Muthoni wanted only her phone  How ex-school head Jane Muthoni planned husband’s murder  Kiru School principal’s widow declared guilty of murder According to June, the absence of their father in their lives still hurts and it was unfortunate that it can’t be undone.  “We are all students and have fee arrears.
