Plans are underway to construct a 181-kilometer dual carriageway between Rironi in Limuru and Mau Summit, Nakuru.  A joint team from Kenya National Highway Authority (KeNHA), Nakuru County engineers and physical planners made a tour of the much-awaited highway.  It was revealed that a toll station will be set up at Gilgil Weigh Bridge and another at Salgaa centre. Engineer Kefa Seda, the project manager, said the county will be required to share its traffic circulation so that it is integrated in the highway construction.     Disputed land in Nakuru sprayed with killer substance  Government shuts down 30 unregistered schools in Nakuru  Lanet Airport will be ready in August next year, says agency  KCSE top achievers at Nakuru High school dream of becoming rugby superstars  Medics at the Nakuru level-5 hospital have successfully removed a neck tumor from a 4-year-old boy  Residents of Nakuru to wait longer before they can enjoy water supply from the Itare dam project  Flamingo Calamity: Two thirds of Lake Nakuru flamingoes displaced due to rising water levels By Patrick Beja | 12 hours ago By Nanjinia Wamuswa | 2 days ago By Nzomo Mutuku | 3 days ago By Awal Mohammed | 3 days ago
