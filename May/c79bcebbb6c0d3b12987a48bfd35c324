The main suspect in the murder of National Land Commission employee Jennifer Wambua is unfit to stand trial, the High Court sitting in Machakos heard.  Justice David Kemei deferred the trial of Peter Mwangi Njenga alias Sankale to enable him undergo treatment for an undisclosed condition after a request by his lawyer Dorine Mwau.  Njenga was supposed to take plea in connection with the murder of Ms Wambua whose body was found dumped in Ngong on March 12, this year.    According to a medical report presented before the court and signed by one Dr Korir Tarus, the suspect, who had been ordered to undergo a medical assessment last week, is said to be on medication and therefore not medically fit to stand trial.  What’s the fair value of forced land acquisition?  Jennifer Wambua murder suspect charged  Key suspect in Jennifer Wambua murder case to take mental test  Key suspect in Jennifer Wambua murder arrested The plea to have the accused held for more days was not objected to by the prosecution who asked the court to have Njenga arraigned on June 22.
