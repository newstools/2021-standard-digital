A chief in Zimbabwe has ordered the exhumation and reburial of Robert Mugabe's remains at the national heroes' shrine in Harare after accusing the late leader's wife of breaking local custom by interring him at his rural home in 2019.  Mugabe, who was ousted in a coup that brought Emmerson Mnangagwa to power in November 2017, was buried at his village of Kutama after weeks of dispute with Mnangagwa's government over his final resting place.  A traditional chief in Zvimba district, which includes Kutama, said he had received a complaint from a Mugabe clan member over the manner of his burial.  After presiding over a village court last Thursday, Chief Zvimba on Monday issued a ruling that found Grace Mugabe guilty of breaking traditional norms by burying her husband in the courtyard of his home.    Zimbabwe government challenges ruling against chief justice  Leap of faith: Bungee jumping on Zambezi River  Kenya Sevens edge Zimbabwe in South Africa Solidarity 7s opener  Zimbabwe minister Shiri, who helped plot Mugabe ouster, dies at 65  Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe celebrates his 92nd birthday   Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe slams United Nation at AU Summit 2016  Mugabe ataka Afrika ishirikishwe kwa baraza la usalama By Jael Mboga | 13 hours ago By Jael Mboga and Agencies | 1 day ago By Reuters | 1 day ago By Philip Mwakio | 1 day ago Mohamed Bashir company recently won Sh2.53b tender deals
