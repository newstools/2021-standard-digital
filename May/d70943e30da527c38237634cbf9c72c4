A large ship has stalled at Likoni ferry channel blocking maritime and ferry traffic to and from the Port of Mombasa.  The giant ship, which is over 200 metres long, developed technical problems, interrupting normal operations at the channel.  It had just left the Base Titanium berth and it was laden with the mineral when it stalled about 100 metres away.  Four ferries were in operation during the evening rush hour.  "An outbound loaded cargo ship developed a technical hitch at the ferry crossing route, interrupting normal ferry operations as the four vessels have to manoeuvre past the ship," said the Kenya ferry in a statement.  KPA boss warns over delayed union elections  Boat carrying 200 people capsizes in Nigeria  Kenyan volleyball superstar reveals how his father influenced him  Cranes and forklifts: Lamu port's logistical nightmare The ferries were forced to take longer routes across the channel.  Two Kenya Ports Authority salvage tugboats were seen towing the stalled ship from the middle of the ocean to Base Titanium.
