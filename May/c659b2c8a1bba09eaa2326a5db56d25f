In Mathare, Nairobi County, brewing chang'aa seems to be legal. Yesterday, tens of drums atop blazing fire passed steam through pipes attached to them into the sewage-filled river.  The brew made here is classified into two: 'Biko' (the cheap one), sold to the residents, and the better one is supplied in upmarket estates.  At the scene, security men idle around to keep an eye on visitors, and with a police station not too far away, one would be tempted to think that the government has legalized the activity. Does the area have provincial administrators? One wonders.      Activists call for arrest of police officers implicated in slum murder  Dos and don’ts in the weird world of booze   Student hostels edge out Murang’a chang’aa dens  Rangers coach Pamzo insists helping Gor didn’t affect the post men  Gor Mahia yalaza Bandari, Ulinzi yasajili ushindi dhidi ya Chemilil Sugar  Knife of Greed: The gut-wrenching story of male circumcision among street boys in Nairobi  KTN Weekend Prime Full Bulletin Sports 5th March 2016 KPL week 4 Saturday results By Harold Odhiambo | 1 hour ago By Benard Lusigi | 1 hour ago By Patrick Vidija | 5 hours ago By Paul Ogemba | 15 hours ago Ruto allies dismiss BBI as MPs take a vote on the Bill
