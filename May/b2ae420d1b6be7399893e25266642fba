Police in Kiminini, Trans Nzoia County are hunting a middle-aged man who burnt his mother-in-law’s clothes and bedding on Thursday.  Amos Wanjala, a resident of Sango Village in Sikhendu Location, stormed Mercyline Wanyama’s home in the neighbourhood at 11pm, woke her up, collected her mattress, blanket and a few clothes, which he set alight.  The suspect allegedly threatened to harm the elderly woman if she raised the alarm.  It remains unclear why the son-in-law committed the act, though the victim suspects he was revenging after his wife left him recently.  Mercyline told police that she lost items worth Sh6,000 in the fire.  “He burnt the items outside my house,” she said.  The suspect, thereafter, fled to an unknown destination, police said.  “Once we arrest him, we will charge him with the offence of malicious damage to property,” Kiminini OCPD Francis Tumbo told The Standard.

A resident, Juma Barasa, said they are hoping Mercyline gets justice.  “It is against our Bukusu culture to harm a parent-in-law or destroy his or her property,” said Barasa.  A village elder said Wanjala will be fined a goat, which will be slaughtered and cleansing rituals performed to avert bad omen befalling the suspect or his in-laws.
