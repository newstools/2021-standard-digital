National Assembly Majority leader Amos Kimunya has accused Nyandarua County Governor Francis Kimemia’s administration of claiming ownership of projects being undertaken by the national government.  Mr Kimunya faulted the county government over a tree planting project that saw 600 families get seedlings in Kipipiri.  Immediately after the event, the county government posted on its website that it partnered with Equity Bank to assist the families in getting the seedlings.     Tough Kimunya finally resigns to fate as Jubilee learns tough lesson  I did not consult people of Kipipiri, says flip-flopping Kimunya  Is Ruto's persecution in Jubilee a blessing in disguise?  Ruto has last laugh as Kimunya thrashed in Rurii Ward  Kinara wa cord apinga Jinsi serikali inavyotekeleza uteuzi wa maafisa   Deputy President William Ruto’s pilot charged for assaulting woman police officer  Inspector General orders arrest of Pilot over assault By Boniface Gikandi | 1 hour ago By Mate Tongola | 2 days ago By James Munyeki | 3 days ago By Nderitu Gichure | 4 days ago Grab a copy of the latest Standard for only 10 shillings & access the last 10 editions for free
