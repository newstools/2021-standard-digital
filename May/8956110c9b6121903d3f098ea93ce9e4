Three Cameroon nationals arrested early this month in Ruiru, Kiambu, with more than Sh350 million in fake currency have been charged.  Paulin Francis Proper, Job Kentong and Njikam Omar denied eight counts before senior resident magistrate Catherine Kisiangani.  They were released on a bond of Sh500 000 and one surety. They were also ordered to deposit their passports in court.  The prosecution had asked the court last Thursday to have the three presented in court after detectives got a forensic report from the British and American embassies and the Government Chemist.     Ruiru: Fake Sh362m, gold recovered from house under construction  Police arrest three men with Sh200,000 fake money  Two jailed for defrauding Mombasa businessman  Sh700,000 fake notes impounded in Bungoma  Two men arrested with 693 million Dollars’ worth of fake money in Nairobi  Washukiwa wawili wa uhalifu wauawa Ruiru kwa kupigwa risasi  Police arrest suspect behind Eldoret fake money printing syndicate By Benard Sanga | 11 hours ago By Kamau Muthoni | 11 hours ago By Patrick Beja | 11 hours ago By Moses Nyamori | 11 hours ago President Uhuru Kenyatta furious over recent string of losses
