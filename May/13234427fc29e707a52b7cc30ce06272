The family of former Speaker Nairobi County Assembly Alex Ole Magelo has dismissed rumours of his death.  His wife Lucy Magelo told The Standard that although Magelo was admitted to ICU at a city hospital, he was doing fine.  This comes amid speculations about Magelo, a staunch AFC Leopards supporter.  The wife could not say what is ailing the former speaker but confirmed he had been hospitalised for the past two weeks.  Magelo, who is a member of the Kenya Leather Development Council, last year withdrew from the race to succeed ousted  Nairobi County Assembly speaker Beatrice Elachi and supported current speaker Benson Mutura.  What Kabogo return means for Mt Kenya  What Kabogo thinks of President Uhuru  Former Leopards chairman now petitions FIFA  Battle of titans as Kabogo and Waititu roll up sleeves for April knockout duel Former Kiambu governor William Kabogo had on his Twitter page posted a condolence message but his followers asked him to pull down the post.
