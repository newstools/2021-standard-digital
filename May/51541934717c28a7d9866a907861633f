[File, Standard]  COTU Secretary-General Francis Atwoli and city lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi have accused each other of corruption in a vicious Twitter bust-up.  Atwoli accused Ahmednasir of midwifing a social ill and impunity.  “Some of the problems Kenyans face are because of lawyers like Ahmednasir ...,” said Atwoli in a Friday, May 28 post.  He claimed the lawyer started disliking him after he [Atwoli] stopped him from benefiting in a certain deal.  COTU boss Atwoli gets street named after him  What next for Atwoli after BBI setback?  Weekly Note: Is the grass really green at the Gulf?  Atwoli calls for crackdown on illegal employment agencies Ahmednasir also called for the removal of Atwoli from his COTU position over what he described as unexplained wealth.  Atwoli, however, said he was an honest man who worked hard for his assets.  “My record speaks for itself. I am a very honest man, I work hard, I never engage in corrupt dealings, I speak my mind and I am not a billionaire,” said the COTU boss.  Take a quick survey and help us improve our website! Trouble started after Ahmednasir, in an earlier tweet, castigated the Nairobi County government for naming a street after the trade unionist, saying it sent a wrong signal to suffering workers.  He accused Atwoli of having abandoned workers to languish in poverty as he dined with the high and mighty at their expense.  Atwoli also dismissed as fake reports that the signpost at the road named after him had been removed.  Atwoli honoured  Nairobi County Government on Thursday renamed Dik Dik Road in Kileleshwa after Atwoli in honour of the veteran unionist.  "This road has been renamed after my good friend and brother bwana Francis Atwoli in recognition of his selfless contribution and agitating for the rights of Kenyan workers in the last 54 years," said Deputy Governor Anne Kananu.

Atwoli thanked Kananu's leadership for recognising his role in the trade movement and further reaffirmed his commitment to addressing the plight of Kenyan workers.  "I want to thank the leadership of Nairobi under Anne Kananu, for this great honour and recognition of services to the Government of the day, the community and workers at large. We will continue offering our unwavering support to the leadership of the county," he stated.  Atwoli has now joined the list of other prominent Kenyans such as Kenneth Matiba who had Accra Road renamed after him in March 2021, Garissa Senator Yussuf Haji who had Eastleigh's First Avenue renamed after him; the late football legend Joe Kadenge who had Kapiti Crescent Road renamed after him by the county Assembly earlier this year.
