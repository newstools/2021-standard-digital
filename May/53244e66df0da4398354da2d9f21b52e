A man was on Tuesday charged with giving the police false information that led to the ouster of Unaitas Sacco chairman Joseph Ngaai Kabugu last year.    Alexander Irungu Wanjiru (pictured) appeared before Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi but denied the charges.  Court papers indicated that Irungu reported the matter at the Serious Crimes Unit of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI).  The court heard that the accused told Sergeant Sevelina Kalunge that Kabugu had allegedly forged the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) results to gain admission to Shinners Technical College in Murang’a County.  IG orders probe into sexual harassment claim after female cop's viral clip  Court defers murder charge against Velvine Nungari's prime suspect  Slain Kitengela Four man linked to criminal gang   Two suspected gangsters shot dead in Nairobi The accused allegedly committed the offence on November 28, 2019, at the DCI headquarters in Nairobi.
