Ships and importers at the Lamu Port will now pay half of the cost they incur at the port of Mombasa.  In the new tariffs published by the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) in a bid to lure traders to use Lamu port, stevedoring charges have also been reduced by 40 per cent.  Stevedoring is the loading or offloading of cargo from the ship.  In a notice signed by KPA acting Managing Director Salim Rashid that was released on Thursday, the loading and unloading of motor vehicles will cost 40 per cent less.   Shore handling and wharfage services, which involve loading and discharging of domestic and transit cargo, will also attract a 40 per cent discount.  Goods dropped at Lamu by big ships before they are transported to other small ports will enjoy a 30 per cent free storage period.  President Uhuru tells off critics as he commissions Lamu Port  President Uhuru Kenyatta opens Lamu port  Two ships dock as Lamu Port rolls into action  KPA union workers’ elections cancelled for the third time "A 20-foot container will be charged Sh920 (USD10) from 31-60th day while 40ft container will attract Sh1,840 (USD20),” reads the tariff notice which indicated that transit cargo will enjoy a 30-day free period.
