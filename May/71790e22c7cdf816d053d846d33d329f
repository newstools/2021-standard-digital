The leadership crisis at the Nyandarua County Assembly deepened on Friday after the acting clerk Elizabeth Muthui swore in newly elected Rurii Ward Representative, Muraya Githaiga.  The ceremony was conducted in a special sitting convened by Deputy Speaker Zakary Njeru.  The event came a few days after Speaker Ndegwa Wahome was barred from accessing the assembly, following his reinstatement by Justice Joel Ngugi a week ago.  In his maiden speech, Muraya said one of his priorities is the rehabilitation of roads.     Chaos at Nyandarua Assembly as Speaker Wahome is locked out  UDA rolls out major drive to list aspirants  Ruto has last laugh as Kimunya thrashed in Rurii Ward  Bishop nominee rejected in Nyandarua County Assembly By Mireri Junior | 37 minutes ago By Special Correspondent | 17 hours ago By Jacob Ng'etich | 17 hours ago By Julius Chepkwony | 17 hours ago Grab a copy of today's Standard & Nairobian Epaper for only 10/-
