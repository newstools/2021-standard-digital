Goalkeeper Alisson Becker scored in the fifth minute of stoppage-time as Liverpool snatched a 2-1 victory at the death against relegated West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns on Sunday.  Alisson headed home from a corner to secure what could be a precious three points for Liverpool in their bid to qualify for the Champions League next season.  They stay in fifth place on 63 points from 36 games, one behind Chelsea in the fourth and final qualification position. Leicester City are in third on 66 points with the latter two to meet on Tuesday. Striker Hal Robson-Kanu had scored in his first Premier League start in three-and-a-half years to give West Brom the lead, but Mohamed Salah equalised for the visitors to move level with Tottenham Hotspur forward Harry Kane on 22 Premier League goals for the season.  Both sides missed opportunities to add to their score, but it was Alisson's incredible late winner that clinched a precious victory for the visitors.  Firmino double fires Liverpool to 4-2 win at United  Liverpool team bus blocked en route to Old Trafford   Man United v Liverpool: Five key battles that could determine outcome at Old Trafford  Man United keep Liverpool match plans a secret, fear for more fan protests  Liverpool's Klopp not confident about top-four prospects By Reuters | 1 hour ago By Reuters | 1 day ago By Reuters | 2 days ago By Reuters | 2 days ago
