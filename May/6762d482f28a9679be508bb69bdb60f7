Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned attacks on synagogues and other Jewish cultural institutions in Germany, her spokesman said on Friday.  German police on Wednesday detained more than a dozen men in three cities suspected of damaging a synagogue, burning Israeli flags and starting a fire at a Jewish memorial site, with authorities warning there could be further protests over the conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza.   "Our democracy cannot tolerate such displays of anti-Semitism," government spokesman Steffen Seibert said, adding that Israel enjoyed the German government's full solidarity.  Earlier on Friday, Israel's Ambassador in Berlin, Jeremy Issacharoff, called on Germany to protect the Jewish community.  "The conflict in the Middle East has nothing to do with the Jewish community here. I would urge the German authorities to do all they can to ensure the safety of the community," he told broadcaster ARD.  Palestine Embassy hails Kenya over stance on Israeli attacks in Gaza  Gaza tower housing AP, Al Jazeera collapses after missile strike  Idd: Israel-Palestine conflict dominate celebrations  ICC prosecutor warns against crimes in escalating Israel-Palestinian violence     Embu-Israel MoU: Israel partners with Kenya farmers on an exchange program meant to boost farming  Water Cabinet Secretary launches Galana-Kulalu Irrigation project  Israel Government to pump in 5B to the Galana-Kulalu Food project By Reuters | 10 days ago By Brian Okoth | 21 days ago By Reuters | 24 days ago By Reuters | 28 days ago
