During the second reading, divisions rose within some sections of the House as allies of President Uhuru Kenyatta, ODM Leader Raila Odinga and Deputy President William Ruto took turns to explain why they voted Yes or No.  Murang’a Senator Irungu Kang’ata seemed particularly fired up as he took to the dais to vote. He went on to explain how Murang’a had been sidelined before he was stopped by the Speaker.  Speaker Lusaka: “Senator Kang’ata, you know the whole world is watching us. Vote.”  Kang’ata: “You cannot stop me, Mr Speaker. Murang’a got one constituency, Tharaka Nithi got four. I vote no!” he shouted.  Kang’ata came up again when it was Senator James Orengo’s turn to speak and took over the mic.  “You did not allow me to speak. You are being unfair,” he told the Speaker.  He was however silenced and Orengo who went on to vote a resounding Yes.
