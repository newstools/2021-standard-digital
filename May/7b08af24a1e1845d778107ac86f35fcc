Speaking on Thursday, the former governor announced that he is in the process of registering a new political party on whose ticket he will seek the country's top job.

He added: "I don't agree with President Uhuru Kenyatta that the Kikuyu community should not field a presidential candidate next year. I don't think someone should look at me in terms of a community.
