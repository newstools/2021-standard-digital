Pupils of Simbi Primary School in Rachuonyo North, Homa Bay County failed to attend classes after part of their school was flooded. The flooding was as a result of River Awach breaking its banks following the heavy rains pounding the area. A number of pupils who went to school yesterday had to return home when they found all their classrooms flooded.  School headteacher Washington Akuno said only 108 out of 386 pupils reported to the school that morning, but the floods adversely affected their school opening programme for the third term.  “Many learners were unable to report to school because of the floods. We are stranded on how to undertake our learning programmes,” Akuno said, adding two latrines were also submerged by the rainwater.  “We are in dire need of new latrines to cushion pupils from diseases. I call on well-wishers and the government agencies to come to our aid.”   Simbi Primary has in the past been used as a campsite for flood victims.
