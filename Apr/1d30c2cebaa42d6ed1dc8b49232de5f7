Kapenguria MP Samuel Moroto has said the Building Bridges Initiative is not a priority since the current Constitution is yet to be fully implemented.  Speaking in his constituency, the MP said the 2010 Constitution brought many progressive legislations such as the Equalisation Fund, which uplifted marginalised areas.  His criticism comes as a proposal in the BBI to create additional constituencies has caused a storm in the political arena.  Mr Moroto said the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission should be left to do its work in delimitation of boundaries. He said it was wrong for some MPs to 'lie' to the country that BBI is a solution to Kenya’s problems and that it will help alleviate poverty. Moroto said the initiative would be a burden to the taxpayer due to an expanded Executive and other additional positions.  He said the proposal in the BBI to take 35 per cent of funds to counties would not be practical. “The national government has failed to disburse the current 15 per cent. It has failed to buy enough Covid-19 vaccines... Where will the 35 per cent come from?"  18 Justice and Legal Affairs Committee members sign report on BBI Bill  Senate adjourns for second time after Linturi arrest   Showdown looms as MPs debate BBI Bill  Parliament to hold special sitting to debate BBI Bill     Bumpy BBI Ride: Parliament to hold special sittings to debate the BBI report | HOUSE OF CARDS  BBI Confusion: Uncertainity over special sittings with Speaker Muturi yet to gazzette sittings  BBI Report Row: Joint legal team approves report, creation of 70 new constituencies faulted By Brian Otieno | 2 hours ago By Hassan Barisa | 3 hours ago By Patrick Vidija | 5 hours ago By Patrick Vidija and Jacob Ng'etich | 6 hours ago Read The Standard uninterrupted with no advertisements
