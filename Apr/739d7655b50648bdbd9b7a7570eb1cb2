A man was found dead in a lodging in Thika town in a suspected suicide.  Thika OCPD Mohammed Kofa said the man, identified as Joseph Nyutu, 45, had checked into the room alone on Monday.  “The man booked a room for a night but failed to get out the following morning, raising suspicion. The room attendant notified the manager who informed the police. The door was broken and we found his body lying on the bed. There were two bottles of insecticides by the bedside," he said.  He said initial report suggests that he died of poisoning but post-mortem examination results would establish the real cause of his death.  The body was taken to Thika General Kago Hospital mortuary.  Court release businessman linked to son's murder on Sh1 million bond  Third suspect in journalist Jennifer Wambua murder detained  Man kills wife, locks himself with body inside house for 5 days  Death row convict freed, co-accused to hang     Crime in Nyeri: Three women arrested in Nyeri town for drugging and stealing from men  Nyeri Murder Probe: Nyeri tycoon accused of killing his own son over domestic quarrel between them  Nyeri Murder Probe: Nyeri tycoon accused of killing son over domestic quarrel between them By Nderitu Gichure | 1 hour ago By Kamau Muthoni | 1 day ago By Caroline Chebet | 1 day ago By Fidelis Kabunyi | 2 days ago Read The Standard uninterrupted with no advertisements
