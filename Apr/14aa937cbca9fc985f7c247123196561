Three people accused of cultivating cannabis in Nakuru refused to plead to the charge.  Victor Kungu, his son Broddus Wainaina, and Dennis Matete appeared via a video link before Chief Magistrate Josephat Kalo.  When the court clerk read the charge and asked Kungu to plead, he refused.  Kungu told the court he was only a representative of a Community-Based Organisation (CBO) that is legally mandated to manufacture what he termed ‘medicinal substances’.  “I cannot answer to such charges on behalf of our organisation because the matter is concerning partners, individuals and organisations mandated to manufacture and export medicinal substances,” said Kungu. The trial magistrate entered a not guilty plea for the accused persons.  Suspects accused of cultivating Sh15m bhang refuse to take plea  The politics of weed ablaze on 4/20  Three suspects arrested cultivating bhang  Morocco government backs legalising cannabis for medical use Kungu, who continued speaking despite several attempts to stop him, said the CBO was registered as NKU/W/DSS/CBO/053, under the East African Community Labour and Social Protection.
