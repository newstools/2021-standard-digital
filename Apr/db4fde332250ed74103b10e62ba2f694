ODM deputy party leader and Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has denied claims of planning to decamp to Deputy President William Ruto's camp.  This follows meetings between Oparanya and the DP, which have sparked speculation of a political alliance ahead of next year’s polls. The governor, who applied for the ODM presidential ticket alongside his Mombasa counterpart Hassan Joho, yesterday affirmed that he was committed to the cause.  He, however, did not rule out working with Ruto and corroborated the former's assertions that they have met more than five times to discuss the 2022 politics. “You can be his enemy, but the DP is my friend. Kenyans should allow leaders to express themselves and talk freely,” said Oparanya.  He said since he has declared interest to run for the presidency, he will be meeting other political players as part of his strategy ahead of elections. “I plan to meet Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka to discuss 2022 politics,” he said.     We have enough troops, ODM whips MPs to support BBI in entirety  DP Ruto calls for establishment of state department for Kenyans in diaspora  Editorial cartoon: Kiraitu Reaches Out  Kakamega's ailing hospitals where patients buy own food  Siasa za ODM: Gavana wa Kaunti ya Kakamega, Wycliffe Oparanya anataka aungwe mkono  ODM considering re-opening application for the presidential ticket to accommodate Raila Odinga  Is one Kenya alliance open to a coalition with Raila Odinga? | POLITICAL POINT By Brian Otieno | 2 hours ago By Hassan Barisa | 3 hours ago By Patrick Vidija | 5 hours ago By Patrick Vidija and Jacob Ng'etich | 6 hours ago Read The Standard uninterrupted with no advertisements
