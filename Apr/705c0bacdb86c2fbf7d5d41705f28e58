Authorities in Nakuru County stormed Kihoto Estate on Monday night and seized several illegal nets and six fishing boats in a fight on illegal fishing in Lake Naivasha.  After the raid, youth protested and engaged anti-riot police officers in running battles, affecting flow of traffic on the Naivasha-Mai Mahiu road. The situation was contained.  Naivasha Deputy Commissioner Mutua Kisilu said: “We have towed the six boats to the area police station and recovered tonnes of nets despite opposition from the criminals involved.”  Kisilu told the youth government would not tolerate criminal acts in and around the lake. Sub-county Fisheries Officer Nicholas Kigundu said the operation would extend to other parts of the lake.  According to Lucas Atieno from Central landing beach, cases of thefts targeting nets and fish catch were rampant. He said fishermen had to keep watch at night to protect their nets from theft. “Licensed fishermen are incurring huge losses due to the theft of their nets. We urge the Department of Fisheries to address this,” he said.   Scores injured as licensed, illegal fishermen clash   Coast fishermen seek to be exempt from curfew hours  Lake Naivasha’s fury and damage call for urgent action on climate change  Lake swells, homes flooded, people move       Take a quick survey and help us improve our website!
