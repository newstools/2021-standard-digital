The new board of directors at Kiru Tea Factory in Murang’a County convened their first meeting yesterday but got a cold shoulder from the management of the processing unit.  The management of the factory in Mathioya sub-county gave the directors led by Chairman Chege Kirundi a cold reception, denying them writing materials even after the later settled in the board room to start a meeting.  Kirundi was forced to send a member of his team to Kiria-ini market, five kilometres away to purchase writing materials.  There were celebrations at Kiru Factory at 11.30am when Kirundi’s team entered the factory even as the senior managers were reported to be out of office.  Outlined procedures  “We are here on the strength of the farmers after having been elected in accordance with the procedures outlined in the Articles of Association,” said Kirundi.    The directors transacted business in the boardroom for a few hours before leaving.  Kirundi was last at the factory in 2018 when a bitter leadership row emerged and the guards were instructed not to allow him into the premises alongside Bernard Kiragu, the new company secretary who replaced Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA) company secretary John Kennedy Omanga.

Kirundi is said to have written to the management of KTDA seeking a forensic audit into the operations of the agency at the factory.          By Dominic Omondi | 5 hours ago By Fredrick Obura | 7 hours ago By Winfrey Owino | 9 hours ago By PSCU | 14 hours ago Read The Standard uninterrupted with no advertisements
