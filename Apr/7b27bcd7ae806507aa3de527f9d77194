Several people were injured and boats damaged following a clash between fishermen and poachers around Lake Naivasha.  Following the incident, security officers announced a major crackdown against tens of illegal fishermen who invaded the lake in the last year.  This came as the fishermen raised concern over theft targeting their nets and catch by the gangs who have taken over the lake.  In the last couple of months, some gangs have taken over control of sections of the lake, fishing on breeding grounds and using undersize nets.  According to Naivasha Sub-county Commissioner Mutua Kisilu, a group of youth had attacked licensed fishermen leaving scores injured.  State moves to combat illegal fishing at Lake Naivasha  Coast fishermen seek to be exempt from curfew hours  Lake Naivasha’s fury and damage call for urgent action on climate change  Lake swells, homes flooded, people move He said during the incident, the youths stole three boats which were later recovered by security officers.  “We have a gang of youth who think this lake is private property and we shall deal with them as per the law,” he said.
