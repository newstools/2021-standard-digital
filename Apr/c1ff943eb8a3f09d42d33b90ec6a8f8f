The 7am incident caused a huge snarl-up on the Makupa-Changamwe route. [Courtesy]  Three people died on Thursday morning and five others injured in Makupa, Mombasa after a matatu flew over a barrier and collided head-on with a truck.  The 14-seater matatu was headed towards Changamwe from Makupa, when the accident occurred.  Coast regional traffic boss, Peter Maina, told The Standard it wasn’t immediately clear what caused the matatu driver to lose control of the vehicle.  The injured were taken to the Coast General Teaching and Referral Hospital, whereas bodies were taken to the same facility’s morgue.
