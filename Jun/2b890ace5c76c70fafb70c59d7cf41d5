Education CS Prof George Magoha has asked tertiary institutions in the country to focus more on their ‘traditional’ courses rather than trying to copy courses offered in other varsities.  The former University of Nairobi VC said he was disturbed by the trend universities in the country were showing whereby they were copying courses from other institutions for the sake of admitting more students.  “Most Kenyan universities have over the recent years abandoned concentrating on their strong fields of research and training, and instead deviated to all manner of programmes,” he said when opening the newly constructed multimillion-agriculture lab at JKUAT.        I am not my hair, says dreadlocked University of Nairobi student leader  Nacada links UON chaos to drug abuse  University of Nairobi closed indefinitely following student protests over disputed election results  County commander Japheth Koome defends GSU officers  By Nathan Ochunge | 17 hours ago By Paul Ogemba | 23 hours ago By Esther Dianah | 1 day ago By James Omoro | 1 day ago
