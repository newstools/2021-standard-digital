Volunteers search for the body of the missing boy in River Athi.[Stephen Nzioka]  A 12-day search for the body of Stephen Sila who was attacked by crocodiles when he went to fetch water at Kwa Metho, Kitise, in Makueni County, has ended in vain.  The boy was a Class Six pupil at Athiani Primary School.  According to villagers, Sila, 14, had gone to the river with their two donkeys. It is suspected that he was attacked shortly after filling all the jerricans with water.  Fears that Sila may have been killed by crocodiles that have infested Athi River arose after his shoes were found where he was fetching water.   Kalembe's last words to BBI proponents  Uhuru pledges reforms to make farming lucrative  Locals in the bush after eviction for dam’s expansion  MP, journalists arrested in Embu evictions The donkeys returned home without the boy.  “He had gone to fetch water alone. His parents waited for his return in vain long after the donkeys returned home without him. His shoes were found at the point where he was filling his jerricans,” said area assistant chief Musembi Mutuku.  The boy’s father, Fredrick Sila, said although the exercise by trained divers had been called off, he was hopeful that he would one day get part of his son’s body or a piece of cloth to bury. This, he said, would give him peace of mind.  Residents have decried constant attacks by hippos and crocodiles, which have killed many people and left others maimed.
