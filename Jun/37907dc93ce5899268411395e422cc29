Dumping of export fuel and adulteration of the products are two major challenges facing the petroleum industry in Kenya.  According to Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC), this has compounded by conflict of interest in allocation of oil to markets and manipulation of data by some players in the lucrative sector.  Speaking at a two-day training workshop for senior managers from Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC) in Sawela Lodge in Naivasha, EACC chair Eliud Wabukala said oil and gas play a critical role in Kenya’s economic growth.  He, however, noted that there were malpractices that marred the sector including irregular award of tenders, fictitious payment and nepotism.    Businessman in court for unexplained Sh385m in his accounts  Four governors probed over Sh11 billion wealth  EACC chasing public officers with Sh25.5 billion unexplained wealth  EACC officers raid Nyandarua County Gvt.

Wabukala was quick to note that the commission was working closely with KPC towards strengthening anti-corruption initiatives within the company.       I stand by my affidavit,NYS scam suspect Josephine Kabura tells EACC over Waiguru dossier   British government helping Kenya recover Ksh. 525 million stashed in Jersey Island, EACC reveals  Badhii ya wakilishi wa wadi waleta mjadala ya kumn’gatua mamlakani gavana Issac Ruto By Patrick Muinde | 2 hours ago By Jacob Ng'etich and Judah Ben-Hur | 2 hours ago By Peter Theuri | 2 hours ago By Wainaina Ndung’u | 2 hours ago
