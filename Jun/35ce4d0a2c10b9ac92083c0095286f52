The government has banned night fishing in Lake Naivasha.  Naivasha Sub-county security committee and the fisheries department said the ban was meant to contain the rising cases of illegal fishing by gangs that have invaded the water body in the last one year.  The move comes as officers from the Kenya Coast Guards Services (KCGS) arrived in the town to back patrols by officers from the fisheries department.  According to Naivasha Sub-county Commissioner Mutua Kisilu, investigations had revealed that illegal fishing was being done at night.    State moves to combat illegal fishing at Lake Naivasha  Scores injured as licensed, illegal fishermen clash   Lake Naivasha’s fury and damage call for urgent action on climate change  Lake swells, homes flooded, people move Speaking after a stakeholders’ meeting in South Lake, Mr Kisilu announced a major crackdown targeting illegal fishing groups popularly known as ‘ngoja-ngoja’.
