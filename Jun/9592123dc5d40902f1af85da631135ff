Suspected cattle rustlers on Tuesday morning ambushed a contingent of security officers after they raided Lopii Village in Turkana East and made away with an unknown number of animals.   The daring bandits stopped the police officers at Kakulit location where the three vehicles and an armoured personnel carrier were sprayed with bullets.  According to Turkana East sub-county police commander Edwin Ogwari, the officers were forced to take cover as the armed bandits sprayed their vehicles with bullets.  “I can confirm that four of our vehicles were shot at but we have ones which we can use as we repair the damaged ones,” Ogwari said.    One killed, three injured in fresh Olposimoru attack  Tension in Narok South as two boys killed  Locals enjoy peace as guns go silent in Kerio Valley  Probe into stock theft, perennial tribal clashes narrows to 40 suspects During the incident one officer attached to Lokori Police Station was injured after he was hit by a bullet on his left leg near the ankle.
