Workers place a mask on Buddhist goddess Kannon at Houkokuji Aizu Betsuin temple in Aizuwakamatsu, Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. [Courtesy]  Workers scaled a giant statue of a Buddhist goddess in Japan on Tuesday to place a custom-made mask on her face, an act meant to be a prayer for the end of the coronavirus pandemic.  It took four workers three hours to carry the massive mask on ropes up the 57 m-high (187 ft) white statue of the Buddhist goddess Kannon - the Goddess of Mercy - at the Houkokuji Aizu Betsuin temple in Fukushima Prefecture.  They then unfurled the mask made with pink net fabric, measuring 4.1 m by 5.3 m and weighing 35 kg (77 pounds), across the lower half of the statue's face.  The statue, built 33 years ago, is hollow with a spiral staircase that can be climbed to the height of the goddess' shoulder. People visit the statue, which is holding a baby, to pray for the safe delivery of babies and to ask for blessings for their newborns.  Wimbledon cuts 2021 prize purse by 5%  Coast hoteliers yet to get their share of Sh2.3b Covid-19 kitty  Governors propose lockdown to curb spread of Covid-19   Zero deaths reported as Kenya Covid-19 cases up by 485 Buddhist goddess Kannon at Houkokuji Aizu Betsuin temple in Aizuwakamatsu, Fukushima Prefecture, Japan.

Horigane said they plan to keep the mask on the statue until the COVID-19 situation is under control in Japan.    Tracking Covid-19: Kenya records 324 new cases, 10 deaths in last 24 hours  Covid Downward Trend: Kenya records 86 new Covid-19 cases with positivity rate now at 3.1%  HEALTH WATCH: Scientists working on developing vaccine that comes in form of a pill & nasal spray By Reuters | 11 hours ago By Reuters | 1 day ago By Standard Reporter | 1 day ago By Standard Reporter | 2 days ago
