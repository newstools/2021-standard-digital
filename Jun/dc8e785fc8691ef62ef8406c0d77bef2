Debate about allowing couples to use different surnames has become a hot topic. [Courtesy]  Japan's top court on Wednesday threw out a challenge by three couples who wanted to keep their own surnames after marriage, ruling that laws stipulating Japanese couples must choose one family name were constitutional, media reported.  The couples had argued that the provisions were discriminatory, pointing to growing public support for allowing married people to use different surnames.  Debate about allowing couples to use different surnames has become a hot topic among politicians after Yoshihide Suga replaced Shinzo Abe, who is thought to have more conservative views on the issue, as prime minister last year.  While some lawmakers in the ruling coalition support allowing couples to decide on what names they will use, a conservative wing of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has opposed it, saying such a step will damage family unity and go against tradition.   160,000 of girls got married when schools closed, did not resume learning  Teenage girls on contraceptives are either married, have steady partners  One of Uganda's Olympic squad tests positive for coronavirus on arrival in Japan   What’s trending in The Nairobian this week  Msaada wa Japan kwa Kaunti ya Nairobi  Signed Kenya Japan Agreement to increase energy production  Wachezaji chini ya miaka 12 kufunzwa chini ya mradi wa sports for tomorrow By Reuters | 5 days ago By Reuters | 7 days ago By Reuters | 7 days ago By Reuters | 8 days ago
