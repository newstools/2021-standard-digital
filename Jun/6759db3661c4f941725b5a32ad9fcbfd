The company said it would in the coming months test an artificial intelligence tool called 'visual search' so users shopping on its photo-sharing site Instagram can click on items and find similar products in Shops.  Users will be able to use this search from content on the app or on photos on their own camera rolls, Zuckerberg said.  Facebook is also working on ways using augmented reality that shoppers can try on items, including from ads, Zuckerberg said, speaking in a live audio room on Facebook.       WhatsApp users have until 15th May to accept a privacy policy on the platform  President Uhuru Kenyatta ranked 3rd most followed African leader on Instagram  Elewa Sheria: Kanuni zinazotumika katika utumiaji wa mitandao ya kijamii By Sponsored Content | 1 hour ago By Dominic Omondi | 3 hours ago By Fredrick Obura | 4 hours ago By Winnie Makena | 5 hours ago
