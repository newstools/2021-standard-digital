Wilson Sossion announced his resignation as KNUT boss on Friday, June 25, 2021. [File, Standard]  Wilson Sossion has resigned as the Secretary-General of Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT).  While announcing his resignation on Friday, June 25, Sossion said he will now shift his full attention to legislative duties.  Sossion is a Nominated Member of Parliament, who joined the National Assembly in 2017 through ODM Party.  “I have outgrown KNUT. My responsibility now shifts to Parliament,” he said in a press conference held at the Windsor Golf Hotel and Country Club.  Sossion’s family was present during the announcement.  The nominated legislator has been at the helm of KNUT politics since 2013.  Of late, Sossion has been embroiled in a protracted battle with the TSC, which deregistered him as a teacher after he was nominated to the National Assembly.  Sossion alleged TSC was out to cripple KNUT, and consequently hoard control of teachers’ welfare.
