The Kenya National Examinations Council (KNEC) has appointed Dr David Njeng’ere Kabita as its new Chief Executive Officer (CEO), for a period of five years.  Dr. Njeng’ere will assume office on July 1, 2021, according to a statement by KNEC’s Chair Dr John Onsati.  He is currently an advisor to Education Cabinet Secretary Prof George Magoha and replaces Dr Mercy Karogo, who has held the position for the last five years.  According to the Education World Forum, Dr Njeng’ere has previously served as Deputy Director at both the Kenya National Examinations and the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development.  The educationist with over 30 years experience is also a specialist in curriculum design and assessment.  Onsati said in a statement that Njeng’ere was instrumental in the conceptualisation and design of the Competency-Based Curriculum and Competency-Based Assessment.  He is a Hubert Humphrey fellow and holds a Ph.D. in Education, a Masters in English, a Bachelor of Education in English and Literature, and a Post Graduate Diploma in Curriculum Design and Development.  Knec advertised the position in April this year, in which it said it was looking for a firm, self-driven, results-oriented, dynamic, innovative, robust, fair, and transparent leader.  The outgoing CEO was appointed during CS Fred Matiang’i’s tenure at the ministry, coming in at a time Knec was contending with rampant exam malpractices.      By Kariuki Waihenya | 12 hours ago By Nathan Ochunge | 1 day ago By Mumo Munuve | 2 days ago By Wesonga Robert | 2 days ago Read The Standard uninterrupted with no advertisements
