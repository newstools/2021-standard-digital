A man and a woman arrested in connection with the kidnapping of Kamukunji businesswoman Hafsa Mohamed appeared before a Nairobi court yesterday.  Police sought the court’s permission to detain Jackson Njogu Wanjiru and Hafsa Abdi Ahmed for 14 more days to complete investigations.  In the application filed before Makadara Chief Magistrate Hetson Nyaga, investigating officer Mary Wandia said more suspects were at large.  It was her case that the two suspects and others not before court took the victim to Kayole junction to introduce her to watermelon supply business.  But as they were leaving the shop, they were met by two men who abducted the victim and took her to a secret location within the same area.  ‘My business partner plotted my abduction, stole Sh658,000 from me’  Hafsa Mohamed: My friend masterminded my abduction, torture   Two suspects behind Hafsa Lukman’s kidnap arrested  Men cornered, beaten up in Zimmerman were mistaken for kidnappers: police The officer, in an affidavit, said she needed more time to conduct an identification parade and record statements.
