Baby Liam Ngucwa Mwangi, 4, is believed to have been kidnapped by Charles King’ori, his grandparents’ houseboy.

The devastated parents and relatives had made an online appeal regarding their son’s whereabouts.   Abducted boy from Thika found safe, suspect arrested  Teacher’s 35-hour ordeal with kidnappers on Eldoret highway  Kisauni woman found with hands tied to steering wheel, boyfriend killed  Why reporting stolen phones to police is teary affair for victims In the post that went viral, the couple had asked the public to volunteer any information they may have about their missing son.   “Our son was last seen in Thika, in the company of one Charles King’ori alias Delvin Maina who was our houseboy,” they said.  Holding their son as they fought back tears after the reunion, the parents could not hide their joy after almost a week-long search.  Baby Liam was rescued by DCI detectives after what they term as “a meticulous mission, executed by detectives from the Crime Research and Intelligence Bureau, augmented by their Special Service Unit counterparts”.
