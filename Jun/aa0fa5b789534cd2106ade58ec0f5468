Former Mali Vice President Assimi Goita. [Reuters]  The African Union has suspended Mali's membership in response to last week's military coup and threatened sanctions if a civilian-led government is not restored, it said in a statement on Tuesday.  The military arrested interim President Bah Ndaw and Prime Minister Moctar Ouane last week and pressured them to resign, derailing a transition to democratic elections after another military coup last August ousted the previous administration.  Former vice president Assimi Goita, a colonel who led the August coup and last week's revolt, was declared president on Friday.  The African Union called for "an unimpeded, transparent and swift return to the civilian-led transition ... failing which, the Council will not hesitate to impose targeted sanctions," the AU's Peace and Security Council said.  Ecowas suspends Mali over second coup in nine months  Mali's top court declares coup leader Goita as interim president  Ousted Mali president and prime minister freed by military  Ex-Ghanaian President Mahama quits AU’s Somalia mediator role Mali's neighbours and international powers fear the latest revolt will jeopardise a commitment to hold a presidential election in February, and undermine a regional fight against Islamist militants, some of which are based in Mali's desert north.  West African regional bloc ECOWAS suspended Mali on Sunday.
