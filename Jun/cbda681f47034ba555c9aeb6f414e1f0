Residents of Kandutura village in Rongai, Nakuru County, were shocked on Thursday when they woke up to find members of a family exhuming the body of a man said to have died 37 years ago.  The man, identified as Gideon Kihara, is said to have died in 1984. However, his family has since moved to another land in the neighbouring Kimangu village.  The family said it wanted the relocate the remains of the man to their new home.  His eldest son Samson Njuguna said the decision to exhume his father's remains was reached by his family several months ago.  "We noticed part of the grave is on the road. We fear it may be dug up as the road is being constructed. That is why we decided to have his remains removed and buried afresh, in the new land where we moved to, as our sign of honour to him" said Njuguna.  Man attends ‘his’ burial ceremony on leaving jail  Elijah Obuong’s mother: Why I exhumed son’s body  If Kalonzo, Raila don’t unite in 2022, Ruto will have a field day: Ngilu  Kalembe Ndile's burial at Mbui Nzau, Makueni county [PHOTOS] The family is expected to rebury Kihara's remains later today.

A group of local youth joined the family in exhuming Kihara's remains.  Njuguna said there will be a brief church service at his father's new grave before reburial.  kgachuhi@standardmedia.co.ke       Huruma CDF Social Hall that housed more than 100 households that survived building tragedy closed  Politicians challenge the Police to investigate the murder of Jacob Juma  Mama Lucy Kibaki's burial ceremony By Stephen Rutto | 1 day ago By Stephen Rutto | 2 days ago By Peterson Githaiga | 2 days ago By Titus Too | 3 days ago
