The programme is funded by the county in partnership with the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation.  It has been praised as a measure to control the spread of the coronavirus since there will be little or no physical interaction.  World Bank Group Kenya Competitiveness Enhancement Programme Manager Sarah Ochieng said the platform will require continuous update of the hardware and software for it to be successful.
