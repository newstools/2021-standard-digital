The Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) has commissioned a refurbished tug boat jetty at the Dockyard in the Port of Mombasa. The reconstruction cost KPA Sh500 million.  Presiding over the ceremony, KPA board chairman General (Rtd) Joseph Kibwana said the facility for tug boat maintenance remains vital, with Mombasa port being a compulsory pilotage harbor.  ''This modern facility forms a crucial component of port operations and is replacing the old jetty which was demolished in 2020, after serving as a docking point for 70 years,'' Kibwana said, adding the new jetty will last at least 80 years.  KPA acting Managing Director Eng Rashid Salim said the old jetty needed repair as it no longer supported emerging loads and did not meet modern design specifications.    How do you pay a foreign seller you have never met?  Coast leaders root for revival of stalled fishing port at Shimoni  KPA boss warns over delayed union elections  Kenyan volleyball superstar reveals how his father influenced him     Port standoff: truck drivers fear for their jobs  Tax Evasion Scam: KRA and KPA officials colluding with importers to help them evade tax  Basketball defending champions Kenya Ports Authority emerge winners of Umoja Safe Spaces By Ken Mwige | 18 hours ago By Fredrick Obura | 21 hours ago By Allan Mungai | 1 day ago By Anne Atieno | 1 day ago All eyes on CJ Martha Koome as Uhuru jolts Judiciary
