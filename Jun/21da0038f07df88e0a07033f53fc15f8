The incident occurred at 8:55pm Tuesday at Koyolo Village in Gem East Location, Rangwe Sub-County. [James Omoro, Standard]  A 40-year-old Early Childhood and Development Education (ECDE) teacher from Homa Bay was on Tuesday night shot dead by unknown people.  Clinis Atieno Ojenge was washing utensils outside her house when the armed gangsters stormed the homestead and fatally fired three bullets in her head.  The incident occurred at 8:55pm at Koyolo Village in Gem East Location, Rangwe Sub-County.  Ojenge, a mother of five, died on the spot.  Her 9-year-old daughter, who was in the vicinity, sustained injuries after a stray bullet hit her in the stomach.  The minor was taken to Asumbi Mission Hospital for emergency treatment and thereafter transferred to the Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital.  Ojenge’s mother-in-law Teresa Adera told The Standard she fails to understand who wanted the mother of five dead.  “I heard three gunshot sounds last night (Tuesday, June 15). When I rushed outside, I saw Atieno lying in a pool of blood, with a spoon clutched in her hand,” said Adera.  “Atieno rarely got in trouble with anyone. Every evening, upon returning home from work, she would visit her shop in Rangwe shopping centre. I am yet to know who she wronged,” said Adera.  Rangwe Sub-County administrator, Amadi Simba, asked police to ensure Ojenge’s killers are arrested and prosecuted.  Homa Bay DCI boss Monica Berege pledged speedy investigations into Ojenge’s killing.  The deceased was moved to Homa Bay County Teaching and Referral Hospital morgue.  Ojenge was employed by the county government as a teacher at the ECDE Centre in Gul Kagembe Primary School.
