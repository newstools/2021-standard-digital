[Boniface Gikandi, Standard]  Usawa Kwa Wote party associated with Murang’a Governor Mwangi wa Iria has kicked off a national recruitment drive targeting four million members.  The party has mobilised over 2,000 volunteers to facilitate registration of new members in counties ahead of next year's general election.  The exercise kicked off on Thursday in the counties of Murang’a, Laikipia, Nyeri, Kiambu, Lamu, Isiolo among others where the party felt it had a foothold.  Governor Mwangi wa Iria said the exercise will be coordinated by constituency managers who have already received registration materials for the three-month exercise.  When we ignored telling warning of the devil and paid with rivers of blood  Of new political parties and looming legal suits  Polls body stares at tight calendar ahead of elections  Calls to revive Nasa dominate Midiwo memorial service “The party officials have been meeting in their counties laying strategies to get more members and facilitating transfer from other political parties,” said Iria, who has declared interest to run for the presidency in 2022.
