He challenged senior government officers with the tendency of asking Ministry officials to place their children in certain schools, saying this behavior will not be tolerated.  “For those very senior government officials who can afford to take their children to say, Kabarak…why don’t you take your child there instead of asking us to displace another child to create space for yours? I don’t want to hear it. I will eve switch off my phone,” he warned.  He also challenged school heads to ensure candidates made wiser decisions as pertains the selection of schools, saying that some candidates will miss their preferred schools due to an influx.  Faith Mumo, the top student in last year’s KCPE with 433 marks will join Kenya High, while Samuel Wanyonyi who scored 430 marks will join Mang’u High.  Out of the 1,179,192 candidates who sat the exam, 1,171,265 will join public secondary schools.  The CS said the monies allocated to Education Ministry in the just-read budget for the 2021/22 Financial Year would go into good use, with priority given to issuance of school desks.  The Ministry got Sh202 billion in last week’s budget allocation to support its various programmes.  Sh4 billion will be used for examination waiver for Class 8 and Form 4 students, and Sh4.2 billion for primary and secondary infrastructure.
