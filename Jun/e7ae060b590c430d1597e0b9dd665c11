Over 100 farmers affected by the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) railway construction in Mai Mahiu three years ago are facing another eviction.  This is after the government moved in for their remaining parcels of land, despite failing to compensate them for the losses incurred three years ago.  The farmers from Nyakinyua area vowed they will not give way for the upcoming meter-gauge railway line from the Inland Container Depot in Mai Mahiu to Longonot town.  This came as it emerged that there was a blame game between officers from Kenya Railways and National Land Commission (NLC) over the pending compensation.  Three years ago, NLC took parcels of land in the semi-arid area for the SGR but the government agency has failed to compensate the affected families.  Activists in court to force State to reveal details of SGR loan  How will history judge President Uhuru’s legacy?  SGR gets lion's share of Budget allocation  Kenya to start repaying loans from China in July Joseph Gathuita, a victim, said for three years they have been taken in circles by government officers on the compensation.
