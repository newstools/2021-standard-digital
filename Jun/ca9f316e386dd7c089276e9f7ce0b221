The World Rally Championship flagging off ceremony in Nairobi on Thursday will affect traffic flow on major roads for about six hours.  Some of the roads that will be affected include Thika Road and Uhuru Highway. Motorists have been urged to use alternative routes between 8am and 1pm.  Nairobi traffic boss Joshua Omukata has advised motorists and spectators to avoid risky incidences during the period. ”The vehicles will leave Safari Park Hotel to Kasarani Stadium around 6am then around 8am they will proceed to KICC via Thika Road for the ceremonial flag-off. During the period, there will be traffic disruption on some major roads and we urge motorists to bear with us,” he said.    Joginder Singh, Shekhar Mehta led way for Kenya  Time Safari Rally was the ultimate thrill for Easter  Charm, fairy tales of ‘toughest rally’  It’s finally time for Safari Rally  World champion Sebastien Ogier lays down marker at Safari Rally Kenya International affair  “Around 12.45pm, the first vehicle will be flagged off headed to Ngomongo where spectators will be waiting for the real event.
