The student had borrowed the motorbike from a neighbour. [File, Standard]  A Form Two student died in Homa Bay on Monday, June 7 in a head-on collision involving a motorbike that he was riding and a saloon car.  Eugene Ouko, 17, died on the spot in the night crash that occurred at Pala Market in Rachuonyo North Sub-County.  Ouko, a student of St. Bernard's Otaro Mixed Secondary School, was going to “buy yoghurt” at a shopping centre in Kanyadhiang, when the accident occurred, his family said.  The teenager had borrowed the motorcycle from his neighbour, a boda boda operator in Pala area.  Eye witnesses told The Standard both the vehicle and the motorbike were moving in high speed, when they smashed into each other.  Kanjira Location chief, Elly Obuya, said the driver of the saloon car was rushed to Wagwe Health Centre.  “He (driver) suffered chest injuries,” said Obuya.  So serious was the impact that the vehicle’s airbags deployed, and the engine compartment completely wrecked. The two wreckages were towed to Kendu Boy Police Station.  The student’s body was taken to Kendu Bay Adventist Mission Hospital morgue.  Rachuonyo North Sub-County Police Commander, Sarah Chumo, warned residents against allowing minors to ride motorcycles or drive vehicles.  “The law prohibits children from driving vehicles or riding motorcycles. I warn locals against breaking this law,” she said.   By Anne Atieno | 1 day ago By Anne Atieno | 2 days ago By Mactilda Mbenywe | 2 days ago By Eric Abuga | 2 days ago
