[Reuters]  Nigeria said on Friday it had indefinitely suspended Twitter's activities, two days after the social media giant removed a post from President Muhammadu Buhari that threatened to punish regional secessionists.  Information Minister Lai Mohammed said the government made the move because of "the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria's corporate existence".  He did not spell out what form the suspension would take or give more details on the undermining activities.  Twitter's website and app continued to work in Nigeria on Friday in tests conducted by Reuters.  Twitter removes Nigerian president's 'abusive' civil war post  Boat carrying 200 people capsizes in Nigeria  Nigerian army chief dies in air force plane crash  Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau dead? A spokesperson for Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the suspension.
