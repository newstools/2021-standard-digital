Wajir Governor Ahmed Ali Muktar chaired a special County Steering Group (CSG) meeting to discuss impending drought and mitigation measures.  Muktar called for intervention of government and non-governmental entities and mobilisation of resources to reduce the impact of drought expected to hit the county next month.   "My administration's focus is a shift of mindsets especially in service delivery in critical sectors of health, water, food security, education and climate change adaptation," said Muktar.  He said service delivery has been affected by delayed disbursement of funds by the National Treasury, conflicts and effects of Covid-19.  Addressing the meeting at ICT hall in Wajir town today, the governor said good leadership and political good will was key to address challenges facing the county.  Conservancies are helping to prevent desertification, climate change  Water shortage hits Tana River, locals pray for rainfall  Where goat intestines predict rains, raids, drought, diseases  Council of Governors stands with ousted Wajir leader "I implore all of the government and non-governmental entities to discharge their duties professionally Wajir County," he said.  Muktar noted that drought devastates residents and kills livestock that is key to the economy of the region.

It also warned of increase in malnutrition from 23 per cent to 25.4 per cent in the coming month.  jngetich@standardmedia.co.ke     Janga la Covid-19: Wanafunzi nusu milioni hawakurejea shuleni baada ya likizo ndefu ya miezi tisa  Tracking Covid-19: Kenya records 324 new cases, 10 deaths in last 24 hours  Covid Downward Trend: Kenya records 86 new Covid-19 cases with positivity rate now at 3.1% By Betty Njeru | 2 hours ago By Jael Mboga | 2 hours ago By Jael Mboga | 3 hours ago By Josphat Thiong’o | 6 hours ago
