Archbishop Martin Kivuva at Holy Ghost Cathedral, Mombasa County. April 18, 2019. [Kelvin Karani, Standard]  The Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops has banned political campaigns in churches ahead of next year’s General Election.  Chairman Archbishop Martin Kivuva directed Catholic officials not to allow politicians to take advantage of their congregation to make political statement in churches.  “Let politicians attend and support church functions as congregants but should not be allowed to address congregations. We don’t want politics in Catholic churches,” declared Kivuva.

Kivuva added: “Let campaigns not divide us.”  He urged church leaders who intend to venture into politics to resign.  “Church leaders who want to become politicians should quit and avoid using churches as campaigning tools,” said Kivuva, who is the Archbishop of Mombasa Catholic Diocese.    Exploring the preparedness and the key timeliness of the IEBC to conduct the 2022 General Elections  IEBC launches 2020-2024 Strategic Plan ahead of the 2022 general elections  Raila and Kalonzo's unity plot ahead of 2022 general elections | INSIDE POLITICS WITH BEN KITILI By Standard Team | 4 hours ago By Tobias Chanji | 4 hours ago By Philip Mwakio | 2 days ago By Philip Mwakio | 3 days ago
