On the fateful day, Barasa is said to have attacked the contractor in broad daylight when he learnt that classrooms he was supposed to launch at the school were locked.  Mutungi said the MP had just cut the tape and was about to open one of the classrooms when he discovered it had a padlock.  The contractor told Barasa that he would only open the classrooms once his dues are paid.  A confrontation ensued with the MP allegedly attacking the contractor.  Contractors in the county condemned the incident and called for the arrest and prosecution of MP Barasa.  Mutungi said the police conducted their investigations before arresting the lawmaker. “We are waiting to hear what the court says.”   DCI yaanzisha uchunguzi kuhusu madai Mbunge Didmus Barasa aliwalaghai vijana mamilioni ya pesa  How one police officer allegedly sprayed bullets on mourners   5 people have sustained bullet injuries after chaos erupted during the burial of slain driver By Daniel Chege | 2 hours ago By Stanley Ongwae and James Omoro | 2 hours ago By Martin Ndiema | 6 hours ago By Mireri Junior | 7 hours ago
