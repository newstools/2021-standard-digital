Police were yesterday called to intervene after a number of Law Society of Kenya (LSK) employees, among them embattled Chief Executive Mercy Wambua, were locked out of their offices.  LSK President Nelson Havi was unhappy that some officers had come to assist the employees whose services he said have been terminated. He wondered why the government was interfering.  Ms Wambua had been assisted by police officers from Dagoretti to access the main gate only to find four council members blocking the office entrance.

The police officers said they came to provide security and did not want to be entangled in LSK’s wrangles.  Standoff at LSK offices as Havi, Wambua teams clash  Ole Gunnar Solskjaer extends contract with Manchester United until 2024   Anger, condemnation after arrest of judges Muchelule and Chitembwe  No decision yet on Rashford surgery, says Man Utd boss Solskjaer Havi and his team claimed the police were breaking the law as they did not have court orders authorising them to get into LSK compound.  LSK is embroiled in a number of court cases, which include running of the society’s accounts, the legality of Wambua's removal from office, and firing of four employees.  Havi stated that LSK was not a parastatal and urged Ministry of Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i to respect the law.  “It is my hope that these officers will inform their boss of the mistakes they did and that they were exposed,” stated Havi.
