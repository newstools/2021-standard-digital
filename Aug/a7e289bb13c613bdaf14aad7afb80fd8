The Court of Appeal is today expected to give a verdict on the nullification of the Constitutional Amendment Bill, 2020 dubbed the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI).  A Seven-judge bench consisting of Court of Appeal President Daniel Musinga, Justices Roselyn Nambuye, Hannah Okwengu, Patrick Kiage, Gatembu Kairu, Fatuma Sichale and Francis Tuiyott will make the landmark ruling, that will shape the political landscape in Kenya.   Chronology of Events:   11:20 am: Justice Fatuma Sichale reads her judgement Help us serve you better by completing our quick survey. Is the basic structure of the doctrine applicable in Kenya?  BBI Appeal: Judges’ decisions so far  BBI verdict: Differences in IEBC quorum arise  Constitutional changes in Kenya since independence  BBI judgement: Terms you need to know  Justice Sichale noted the appellants and respondents in support of the appeal and the respondents opposed to it both relied on scholarly writings as well as history, text and context of the 2010 constitution.  She says scholars were not in agreement on the applicability of the Doctrine. Professors Migai Aketch and Charles Manga supported the non-applicability of the basic structure doctrine in Kenya, while Dr Ojwang, Dr Linda Musumba and Dr Osobu supported the notion of its applicability.  Respondents opposing appeal expressed fear that if the Legislature is left unchecked, the 2010 constitution may be dismembered and mutilated to the extent of it being a shell of the constitution. The respondents urged the court to find out that the basic structure doctrine is rooted in Kenya’s history, text and experience, as well as comparative constitutional theory in the form of decided cases and scholarly works.    Respondent's argument was that the cause must reconcile contradiction, draftsmanship gaps, vagueness and phraseology and arrive at the conclusion that the basic structure doctrine is applicable in Kenya for the safety of the 2010 constitution. They relied on several authorities to support their contention:  Justice Sichale uses the example of a case (Mother Kerubo Moracha vs UoN) in the commission of the implementation of the constitution vs national assembly where the judge (Justice Lenaola) held that:  “Where the basic structure, design and architecture of our constitution is under threat, the court can genuinely intervene and protect it,”   The respondents also relied on other scholarly works including one which stated, “In order to find an amendable basic principle, one has to resort to the interpretation of the constitution as a coherent whole,” she reads.  Respondents opposed to the appeal also argued that notwithstanding the fact that the 2010 Constitution does not expressly bar amendments, it does so implicitly as one has to pay attention to its over-arching themes and/or the spirits of the constitution.   Heavy reliance was placed on an Indian Supreme Court decision on Kesevenanda, where it was held there are some provisions in the Indian Constitution that form the basic structure of a constitution, hence not amendable, not even when the prescribed procedures are adhered to.    Justice Sichale says appellants and respondents in support of the appeal urged the court to find that the 2012 constitution had sufficient safeguards that mitigate against hyper-amendments of yesteryears. They also relied on decided cases, these included:   Council of Governors vs Attorney General where the Supreme Court stated, “Court may not impose a meaning that the text is not reasonably capable of bearing. Interpretation should not be unduly strained. It should avoid excessive peering at the language to be interpreted.   On the invocation of the spirit of the constitution, reliance was placed on a South African decision (Premiere of Kwazulku Natal v President of South Africa) where court held that: “The reliance upon the spirit of the constitution is in my view misconceived. There is a procedure that is prescribed for amendments to the constitution which have to be followed. If that is properly done, the amendment is constitutionally unassailable.”  Justice Sichale goes on to give examples of cases appellants and respondents in support of the appeal relied on.  She highlights the manner in which the 2010 constitution was used and abused for political gains.  She gives the example of Paul Ngei in 1974. He was barred from running for elections having been found guilty of an electoral offence. To save him, President Jomo Kenyatta passed into law a bill pardoning Mr Ngei.        At 10:10 am, Justice Francis Tuiyott begins reading his judgement  He covers just two portions of his decision: One, the basic structure doctrine and its application to Kenya.   He says the basic structure doctrine prescribes that "notwithstanding the absence of explicit limitations on the constitutional amendment power, there are implied constitutional limitations which guard against amendments that change its identity."   He proposed the doctrine should be rejected because: "Had the framers of the constitution intended this category of limitation to be part of the law, then they should have found explicit expression in the text of the constitution."   Another matter he reflects on is what constitutes the basic structure in Kenya's constitution. Justice Tuiyott says, "fundamental alterations to the core of the constitution requires the exercise of the primary constituent power of the people."  He says it is Common ground interpretation of the constitution is influenced by both text and context.  He gives an example of the Supreme Court of India decision in the Reserve Bank vs PLS General Finance Investment and company, where the court said interpretation must depend on text and context. If the text is texture, context gives colour.  He says a history of the making of the 2010 constitution gives colour to the text of the provisions of Chapter 16 on amendments.  Justice Tuiyott points out the Bomas of Kenya initiative encountered a legal challenge, presented in the Njoya and six others vs Attorney General and another. The appellant in these proceedings earlier sought a declaration that certain provisions of the Kenya Review Act diluted the constituent power of the people to adopt a new constitution.  He says the making of a new constitution could be through the exercise of people’s constituent power perfected in a referendum. The Kenya Review Act was thus amended to provide for a mandatory referendum to ratify a new constitution.   He continues: “There was now a mechanism provided by statute for the adoption of a new constitution after the exercise of people’s constituent power in a referendum but which mechanism was not contemplated by section 47 of the repealed constitution. In the run-up to the referendum, the process faces another hurdle,”  He outlines a case in Nairobi (Miscellaneous civil application No 677, Onyango and 12 others vs Attorney General and 2 others).  An issue that arose in those proceedings, which he says relates to the matter at hand was whether a new constitution could validly come into being without an amendment to section 47 of the existing constitution.  The three-judge bench then, observed as follows: “However, the exercise of legislative power and the distinction is not applicable to the making of a new constitution by a constituent assembly or referendum because constituent power is not subject to the restrains of any external authority. The constituent power to frame a constitution is unfettered by any external restrictions and is a plenary law-making power. The power to frame a constitution is a primary power, whereas the power to amend a rigid constitution is a derivative power since it is derived from the constitution and is subject to the limitations imposed by the prescribed procedure …”  On whether or not the constituent power of the people needed to be textualised, the judges said, “This court does not regard this as good constitutional law or justice. Section 47 does not deal with the making of a new constitution or the process of making one. The power to make a new constitution was not vested in Parliament, it is the amending power that is vested in Parliament, subject to the special procedures concerning the entrenched provisions and also subject to the doctrine of the basic structure …”    Important for the discussion at hand: There was an attempt to replace the constitution by the people exercising their constituent power, notwithstanding that the power was not expressly provided by the constitution sought to be replaced.  “A recognition in my view, that the power was not subject to restrictions or limitations prescribed by the written words of the constitution…”  Justice Tuiyott also highlighted a fresh drive to replace the constitution which came after the 2007/08 post-election violence. Here, he says Parliament enacted the Constitution of Kenya Review Act and the Constitution of Kenya Amendment Act. The latter Act introduced Section 47 to the then existing constitution, making provisions for its replacement.  The new 2010 constitution was therefore created in the context where the constituent power of the people to replace their own constitution has been codified in the constitution that was to be replaced.   Lesson to learn in this journey: 2005 and 2010 referendums are testimony that the people of Kenya embraced and adopted a constitutional making concept in which the sovereign rights to replace it was exercisable.  “The 2005 referendum tells us that constituent power is unfettered and unlimited notwithstanding that it is not textualised in the constitution to be replaced. While codifying the constituent power is good practice, failure to do so neither takes away or weakens the force of that power,”  He notes the provisions of Chapter 16 makes reference to the word ‘amendment’. He says Chapter 2 of the Interpretation and General Provisions Act is not helpful since those provisions don’t apply in the construction or interpretation of the new constitution.  “Unless otherwise expressed by a constitution, an amendment entails a minor revision, alteration or addition, but which nevertheless does not destroy the constitution being amended. It does not extend to abrogation, complete re-peal or replacement…” says Justice Tuiyott.  He says an amendment to transfer Judicial authority to the Executive is ‘un-making' the constitution since it fundamentally alters a central feature of the constitution. He argues an amendment is not as drastic because properly defined it keeps the altered constitution in unison with its pre-changed identity and structures.  He then refers to Article 255 (1), whose provisions he says only provide for an amendment, anything further must be sanctioned by the exercise of primary constituent power. The provisions of this article and the popular initiative were made against the backdrop, that the making/un-making of the constitution is a preserve of the people exercising their primary constituent power. A change that derogates from the core character of the Constitution is not a change in unity with it, but one that defaces it. That change too is one that can only be made by people organised and exercising their primary constituent power. By falling short of making provisions and procedures for un-making, re-peal, re-enactment, or abrogation of the constitution a textual reading of Article 255(1) is in accord with the contextual interpretation of the clause. The power to make such change rests elsewhere, in the primary constituent power of the people and it need not be codified.
