Please ignore such malicious rumours. I am not aware of such developments and there can be no grain of truth in them as there's no vacancy in the office of the CEO KFCB,” he tweeted.  Dr. Mutua has been at the helm of KFCB operations for two three-year terms, since 2015.  It is unclear whether the expiry of his term as KFCB CEO has led to the unceremonious exit.  The new KFCB boss, Christopher Wambua, served as the Director of Communications and Public Affairs at the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA), a position he ascended to in 2015.
