"It is unfortunate that we've lost Muthoni Kimathi to the cruel hand of death at a time when her family, especially Mama Mukami Kimathi, needed her the most as a close caregiver," the President eulogised.  Ruto: I don’t mind AP security, they can even bring G4S  Our son's killers will never know peace, say slain student's family  Full transcript of Uhuru Kenyatta’s interview with senior editors at State House, Nairobi  Ruto: I will not resign The President remembered Muthoni as a cheerful person who went out of her way to ensure Mama Mukami Kimathi, the aging widow of freedom fighter Dedan Kimathi, was well taken care of and prayed for God's comfort as the family comes to terms with her demise.
