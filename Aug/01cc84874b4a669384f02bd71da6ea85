Bio-septic toilet being cleaned. [Collins Oduor, Standard]  Cases of trachoma in Kitui county have drastically reduced thanks to an initiative to boost good sanitation.  Joseph Mutisya, a cataract surgeon noted that the county has ensured a constant supply of water to residents and clean toilets.    The county government pumps water from Athi River and supplies it to locals in Kitui South and Kitui Rural.  “Though not every homestead is connected to piped water, at least, they can access the commodity, unlike 20 years ago, when they were forced to walk tens of kilometres,” explains Mutisya, adding, “this is what has helped us improve sanitation.”    Carrying lunchbox is healthy, cheaper  Men don’t fall sick, they just feel unwell  Onsite sanitation system replaces exhaust model  Murang'a residents oppose operation of Sh11m sewer plant  According to the 2019 Census, in 2012, only about 70 per cent of the households had toilets. Currently, total toilet coverage stands at 95 per cent.  Mutisya added that in 2012, trachoma cases stood at 4,200, but drastically reduced to 1,800 and are currently below 1,000. The most affected areas include Mwingi North, Kitui Central, Kitui Rural and Mwingi Central.   “We do not have active trachoma, which means the disease is no longer being transmitted. We are happy that we have successfully fought the disease that used to affect the elderly,” he said.   He added that they hold counseling sessions for the elderly, who have to be operated on, and regular sensitization by community health volunteers.     Governor Charity Ngilu urges Kalonzo and Raila to mend fences and work together ahead of 2022 polls  Kitui County government bans limestone mining activity as locals decry environmental harm  Wenyeji wa Makueni na Kitui wapinga ujenzi wa bwawa linalotarajiwa kuzindliwa na rais Uhuru By Hudson Gumbihi | 7 hours ago By Elvince Joshua | 14 hours ago By Willis Oketch | 16 hours ago By Brian Okoth | 17 hours ago
