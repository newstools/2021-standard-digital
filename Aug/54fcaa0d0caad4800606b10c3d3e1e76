Urinating in an undesignated place can cost one a fine of between Sh10,000 to Sh500,000.  If you blow your nose without a handkerchief or tissue paper in Nairobi, you risk being fined between Sh10,000 and Sh500,000.  One also risks imprisonment of between six to 12 months.  New rules and regulations aimed at keeping Nairobi clean are contained in the Nairobi City County Public Nuisance Bill, 2021 that has been signed into law.  Other misdemeanours include urinating in undesignated spaces and spitting on the streets.  In a statement, acting Nairobi Governor Ann Kananu said Nairobi residents should familiarise themselves with the new law.  "Nairobi is the face of Kenya. We all need a clean and hygienic environment to live and work in," she said.  The new law also prohibits the discharge of dirty water, sewer, or effluent into streets or water channels, discharge of oils into roads or water channels, and obstruction of roads or streets.  It also prohibits residents from allowing trees and hedges in their homes or places of work to obstruct streets or footpaths.  The new law also criminalises riding motorcycles or driving on footpaths, playing loud music, and smoking in undesignated places.  Nairobi county attorney Lydia Kwamboka said application of the law will be strict, thus residents should take more responsibility.  “The Act empowers the county to take all lawful, necessary and reasonable practical measures for maintenance of the county at all times in a clean and sanitary condition, abatement and prevention of public nuisance and remedy any nuisance," she said.  County environment executive Larry Wambua lauded Riruta MCA Kariuki Kiriba for coming up with the bill at the assembly and ensuring that all stages were well articulated.
