One person died while four others are receiving treatment at the Kerugoya Level Four Hospital after they were buried alive when soil caved in a sewer project they were working on at Kiandieri area, Kirinyaga County.  The five were among casual labourers working on the Kerugoya-Kutus sewer system when the accident happened at 1:00 pm.  Three managed to escape the trench when they noticed the soil coming down. The trench they were working on was narrow slowing down rescue operations that took three hours.  According to Kirinyaga Central Deputy County Commissioner Daniel Ndege, the piping was being done by eight people and that is why the reports indicated eight had been buried alive.  Seven feared dead after machine crumbles at construction site in Kilimani  Two killed at construction site as job hunt turns tragic "We have lost one person who was working on the Kerugoya-Kutus sewer system project, four have been taken to Kerugoya Level Four Hopsital where they are receiving treatment," said Ndege.     Two people feared dead after construction site collapses on them in KPA village in Embakasi  Kenya Human Rights Commission launched report on Lamu operations titled “Insult to Injury”  Construction of Rwanda’s capital Kigali continues  By Jael Mboga | 7 hours ago By Wacuka Kiarie | 1 day ago By Boniface Gikandi | 1 day ago By Phares Mutembei | 1 day ago Why banking on Kenya’s middle class has destroyed businesses
