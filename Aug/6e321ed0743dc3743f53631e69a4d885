The Judiciary went digital in case filing and payment last year in March, in a bid to improve efficiency and stop revenue leakage.  Lawyers and other litigants are required to file and track their cases in courts across the country electronically. Payments for court services were also automated in the new directive.  Former Chief Justice David Maraga in Gazette Notice No 2357, said the shift from manual to digital system was aimed at speeding up resolution of court cases.  Kenya’s courts have previously been experiencing huge case backlog blamed on the manual system that, in some instances, has seen court files go missing thus stalling progress of cases.
