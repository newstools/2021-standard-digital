Relatives of the four young men killed by villagers in Isinya, Kajiado have demanded justice though the family spokesman Joseph Macharia, an uncle, who has said the four were innocent.  "It's not logical that these young men were on a mission to steal livestock as it is alleged. It's not the first time they had visited the area for fun," said a grieving Macharia.  They had left on Saturday, riding on three sports bikes, and proceeded to Kisaju, an area between Kitengela and Isinya in Kajiado to celebrate a birthday.
