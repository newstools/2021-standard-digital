Some five hundred and fifty-nine patients have also recovered from the disease “with four hundred and thirty-nine being from the Home Based Isolation and Care program while one hundred and twenty are from various health facilities across the country,” Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe said in a brief.  Total recoveries now stand at 199,998.  “1,929 patients are currently admitted in various health facilities countrywide, while 9,043 are under the Home-Based Isolation and Care program. 138 patients are in the ICU, 64 of whom are on ventilatory support and 67 on supplemental oxygen, and seven patients are under observation,” the ministry added.  Kenya has so far administered only 1,922,085 vaccines, and only 2.7 per cent of the adult population is fully vaccinated as at August 12, 2021.  Further, the Health Ministry has warned companies purporting to provide insurance against vaccine side effects terming it unnecessary and unethical.  “The Ministry of Health wishes to state that insurance against side effects is not only unnecessary but unethical. No company should claim to provide insurance services against vaccine side effects or side effects of any medicine. An advertisement of such services is misleading to the public and creates unnecessary anxiety among people who are already at risk of severe Covid-19 disease,” it said yesterday.
