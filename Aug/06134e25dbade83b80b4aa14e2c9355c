Kajiado Town. [Courtesy]  A 29-year-old man is fighting for his life and is set to be charged with attempted robbery with violence after attacking a security guard at a local pub with a toy pistol.  In a tweet by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, police said that the event took place on Sunday, August 29 early morning when Joshua Kalama, used a branded toy pistol to forcefully access an entertainment joint within Kajiado town.  “He made the miscalculated move after a security guard at Square Bar, Kajiado stopped him as he tried to gain entry to the club,” DCI said.  Police Reports indicate that when the guard allegedly asked the suspect to stop, he reached for a weapon on his waist before ordering him out of his way.  Integrity law has failed to subdue politicians but who is to blame?  Husband stabs wife's suspected lover after finding them in bed at dawn  Judge sues police over 'humiliating, dramatic arrest'  Kalonzo Musyoka at DCI over Yatta land grabbing claims “Otieno almost gave in but when the damned ‘pistol’ failed to fire, the guard swiftly pinned him to the ground, raised an alarm, attracting security guards from establishments within the town,” DCI added.  Jointly, detectives say the guards beat up the suspect brutally.  Police officers stationed at Kajiado intervened and helped the suspect who is on treatment before he is arraigned when investigations into the matter are over.
