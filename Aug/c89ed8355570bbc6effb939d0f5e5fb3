The Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union (KMPDU) has threatened to paralyse operations at Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) over the alleged sacking of 40 doctors.  Union officials claimed that at least eight doctors have already been sacked, while the rest have received three months' notices terminating their contracts.  Davji Atellah, the union’s secretary-general, said they would disrupt services at the national hospital every Wednesday of the week until the hospital management agrees to get to the negotiating table over the sackings.

To make matters worse, he said, the hospital had ignored a court order which reinstated the medics.  He spoke in Kisumu on Friday after meeting the union’s branch officials.
