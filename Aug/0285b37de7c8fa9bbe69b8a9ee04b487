A 33-year-old prison warden is believed to have killed himself after a feud with his estranged wife.   The warden is said to have taken his life due to a long-standing dispute with his wife who, according to North Kanyajuok Assistant Chief Joseph Nyamanga, is also a police officer.  Hours before the incident, the deceased had posted on his Facebook page saying; “By the time you are reading this I could have gone. I have reached a point of no return. I am tired with the life I'm leaving. Diana my love, I love you more than I love myself.”  He added: “(name omitted), I leave my family with you, take care of them because you know my wife more than I know her. I am done with this life... I sign out.”    Man commits suicide in Makutano, body found hanging from roof   Stop Playing God  Shock as Migori man commits suicide after death of 'girlfriend'  Body calls for mental desks in county hospitals to curb suicide cases The prison warden while working in Siaya, had kept threatening that he would take his own life since his wife abandoned the family.
