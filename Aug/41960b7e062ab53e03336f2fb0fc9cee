Deputy President William Ruto addressing a press conference on the outcome of the BBI judgement outcome at his residence in Karen, Nairobi on Saturday August 21, 2021 [Boniface Okendo, Standard]  Deputy President William Ruto yesterday said the Turkish businessman Harun Aydin link to an Equity Bank loan was a political twist to his statement.  The DP, through his spokesman David Mugonyi, said the investor he helped acquire a loan from the bank was from East Africa and not the deported Turkish national. “The DP did not help Aydin get money from Equity. He helped some Eastern African investors and it was two years ago,” said Mugonyi last evening.  He accused members of the National Assembly Finance and National Planning Committee of twisting the matter.    DP Ruto writes to IG of police, seeks explanation on security withdrawal  Come clean on Sh15b Aydin loan, a section of leaders to Ruto  Turkish national linked to Ruto not our client, says Equity Bank  Equity on alleged Sh15b loan to Harun Aydin: We don’t know him According to NilePost, a Ugandan news publication, Ruto and Uganda President Museveni laid a foundation stone for a multibillion Biological Drugs and mRNA Vaccine manufacturing facility at Matugga in Wakiso District.
