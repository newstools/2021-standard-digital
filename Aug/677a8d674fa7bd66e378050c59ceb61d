Nominated MP Wilson Sossion. [Courtesy]  Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) Nominated MP Wilson Sossion has rubbished reports suggesting he has ditched the party for United Democratic Alliance (UDA).  Sossion, the immediate former Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT) Secretary-General, termed as “lies” social media rumours linking him to UDA, a political party associated with Deputy President William Ruto.  “Treat other reports as inaccurate propaganda and lies!” Sossion said in a tweet.  But while he has declared his intention to run for the Bomet Senate seat, currently occupied by Christopher Andrew Langat, Sossion, however, did not disclose which political party he will use as a vehicle in the 2022 General Election.  The grey areas in Prezzo UK quest for successor to secure his legacy  Chama Cha Mashinani loses members to UDA  Ghati dumps senatorial bid after Court of Appeal verdict   Nyanza leaders: We are now focusing on 2022 “The fact that I shall vie for Bomet Senate seat in the next election does not mean I have left ODM.
