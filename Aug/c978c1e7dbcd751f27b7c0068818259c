Nakuru East Police Commander Elena Kabukuru at Central Police Station. [Standard]  A 16-year-old girl from Molo, who went missing fifteen months ago, has been found in Nakuru.  The girl was a Form One student at Kambala Girls Secondary School.  She was found four days after The Standard highlighted the matter.  Nakuru East Deputy County Commissioner Eric Wanyonyi said that the girl was lured by a Good Samaritan who handed her over to the police.  "On Tuesday evening, a man who knew the girl's parents traced her in Nakuru town. They met at a hotel and later called the police," said Wanyonyi.    He said that the girl revealed that she had been living in Bondeni with another woman whom she knew from her home area.  "A relatively young woman has been hosting her at her house. During this time, she was working at a club doing laundry," said Wanyonyi.  Nakuru East Police Commander Elena Kabukuru said they had already informed her family. "The girl is safe and healthy. The police will hand her over to her parents," said Kabukuru.  The minor told the police that she left home following differences with some family members.
