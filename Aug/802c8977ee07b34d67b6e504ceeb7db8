A 39-year-old man was on Saturday arrested after he reportedly attacked before stabbing to death another man for sleeping with his wife.   Micah Nyaberi is reported to have stabbed Bonface Maina Njagi after he found him in his Kagoto area house in Nakuru County on Saturday morning while returning from work.  According to Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI) officers, the 3am fight started after Nyaberi returned to his house unannounced, only to find a 34-year-old Njagi relaxing with his wife.  The furious Nyaberi wondered what business Njagi had with his wife Harriet Vivian Mboga, before landing on him with blows and kicks.  'He is a good manager' - Guardiola defends under-pressure Arteta  Listen to doctors, ignore political analysts and go for Covid vaccine   Photos: DP William Ruto at Senator Victor Prengei’s funeral  Premier League: Manchester City demolish Arsenal 5-0 Subdued and seeking to escape with his life, Njagi is reported to have pleaded with Nyaberi to let him have his shoes and leave, but the pleas were met with a stab on his back slightly below the scapula.
