[Courtesy]  Women in Afghanistan have been allowed to attend classes at the university but only if their studies are in line with the Taliban’s interpretation of the Islam law, Taliban’s acting minister for higher education Abdul Baqi said.  Speaking at a council gathering of tribal and faction leaders in Afghanistan on Sunday, August 29, Abdul said mixed classes (men and women) would not be allowed.  "People of Afghanistan will continue their higher education in the light of Sharia law in safety without being in a mixed male and female environment," he said, according to AFP.  AFP reports that Abdul noted that they (the Taliban) were planning to create an Islamic curriculum and be able to compete with other countries.  Taliban celebrate 'complete independence' as last U.S. troops leave Afghanistan  To win war on terror, we must keep our eyes open  Biden warns of another attack on Kabul Airport  Editorial: Afghanistan heat According to Human Rights Watch, most schools in the Asian country were already segregated according to gender and that about two-thirds of girls were not attending schools.
