Environment and Lands Court in Nairobi has barred the government from evicting more than 1,000 squatters from Mathare Mabatini village.  Justice Kossy Bor in her judgement against National Land Commission, the Attorney General, Samuel Ojowa, and Nairobi County ruled that the government should cancel any allocation to individuals and re-allocate the land on a communal basis to the slum dwellers.  The judge noted that Mabatini comprises 350 households and with approximately 1,000 people who have occupied the public land for over 40 years.  Justice Bor noted that it would be absurd to kick the residents out of the place when the government has already earmarked the settlement and the slum for upgrading.    How newspaper cuttings made Onyala global rugby star  Covid-19 cases in slums not a surprise  Writing is on the wall for coronavirus  Protest as police accidentally kill woman in operation “The alienation or allocation of L.R.
