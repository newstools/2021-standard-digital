The deceased was nominated to the Senate by Jubilee Party in 2017.  Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui eulogised Prengei as a “dynamic and dedicated servant of the people”.  “He represented the Ogiek Community in Senate and was a beacon of hope to many. His elevation to the Senate was a major recognition to the rights of the Ogiek and other minority communities. He was a quiet and humble leader, always conscious of the huge burden he carried,” said Kinyanjui.
