Juja MP George Koimburi has said he will fully work with the Jubilee administration. The MP was elected in May by-elections on a People’ Empowerment Party (PEP) ticket.  “Contrary to the perception that I would be sidelined by the government for defeating the Jubilee candidate, the reality is that I am in good books with President Uhuru Kenyatta’s administration,” said the MP.  He added that he had revived many stalled projects initiated by the immediate former MP Francis Waititu alias ‘Wakapee’. They include; the release of 100 power transformers, repair of access roads and upgrading of schools.    Speaking after launching the construction of roads within Juja Township and Tora areas, Koimburi said the time for politics was over and that he was working closely with the government to deliver on his promises.  Jubilee to clean up house in re-structuring plan  Inside Jubilee plan to puncture Ruto's hustlers movement wave  Facing death, Jubilee Party has a lot to learn from the Chinese  We left Jubilee because party leaders failed, Ruto says Meanwhile, the legislator wants the government to pay medical insurance cover for people living with disabilities and increase funding to enable them to start income-generating activities.
