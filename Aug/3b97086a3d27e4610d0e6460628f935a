A Nairobi court has temporarily stopped auctioneers from seizing household items belonging to Kirinyaga Woman Representative Purity Ngirici over Sh5 million helicopter debt.  The order issued by Principal Magistrate D M Kivuti stated: “there be a temporary stay of execution pending further directions of the court, and that the application be served upon the respondents (Purity and her husband Andrew Ngirici) for interpartes directions on August 23, 2021."  Auctioneers raided Ngirici's Runda home on Monday, August 9 following instructions from a flight company, Flex Air Charters.  The auctioneers were, however, unsuccessful, despite being in possession of access warrant. Help us serve you better by completing our quick survey. Daily Nation reported that Murang’a Senator Irungu Kang’ata intervened and promised to help settle the Sh5 million debt.  In 2019, Ngirici was served with a demand letter by Flex Air Charters over the debt.  The legislator had allegedly leased the company’s chopper on diverse dates between May and August 2016.  In the run-up to the 2017 General Election, politicians opted for choppers over cars to campaign, hence gaining an advantage over their opponents.      DCI summons four MPs over 'defamation'  Mwakilishi wa kike, Purity Ngirici amemhimiza Rais Uhuru Kenyatta kuwateua wanawake zaidi katika bar By Martin Ndiema | 6 hours ago By Nderitu Gichure | 7 hours ago By Brian Okoth | 7 hours ago By Winfrey Owino | 9 hours ago
