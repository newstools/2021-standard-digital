The National Assembly will hold a special sitting tomorrow to determine the fate of four Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) nominees who were vetted last week by the Departmental Committee on Justice and Legal Affair (JLAC).  Due to the urgency of the matter occasioned by the nearing general election, parliament will be back from a long recess expected to end on September 21, 2021.  The report will carry four names,  Juliana Whonge Cherera, Francis Mathenge Wanderi, Irene Cherop Masit and Justus Abonyo Nyang'aya who were among the 36 candidates shortlisted and interviewed by the Selection Panel for the appointment of commissioners.  “I, therefore, wish to inform the public that the Special Sittings of the House have been scheduled for Wednesday, September 1, 2021 (Morning and Afternoon) at the National Assembly Chamber, Parliament Buildings commencing at 10.00 am and 2.30 pm respectively,” read the statement by the National Assembly.  Last week, the nominees to the IEBC said they will review policy decisions made by the three current commissioners if approved by Parliament.  Newly-signed Knut recognition agreement is illegal  Musalia Mudavadi faults ODM bid to remove poll team  It's a crowded field as polls agency clears 12 for Kiagu ward by-election  MPs grill nominees set to fill TSC five top jobs The four appeared before the JLAC, which vetted them on their suitability to replace four ex-commissioners – Roselyne Akombe, Consolata Nkatha, Margaret Mwachanya and Paul Kurgat.
