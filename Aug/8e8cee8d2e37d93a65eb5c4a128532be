Other passengers, however, thought she was in a position to persevere, and get medical help once in Mombasa,” said the informant.  “During our conversation, she revealed that she worked as a supermarket attendant in Qatar, and had recently gone to Eldoret to meet her brother before she could fly out of the country this weekend,” said the source.  Yusuf’s relative, Neema Rajab, told The Standard that the woman’s body was taken to the Coast Provincial General Hospital morgue.  “Her burial will take place today (Friday, August 27) at the Kikowani Muslim cemetery in Mombasa according to Islamic customs,” said Rajab.  “Yesterday (Thursday, August 26), we had waited for her arrival for long, before receiving a phone call from the bus attendants informing us that Salma died during the journey,” said Rajab.
