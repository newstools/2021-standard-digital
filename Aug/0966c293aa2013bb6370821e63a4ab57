NCBA Bank has reported a 77 per cent increase in net profit over the half-year to June 2021, continuing the trend in the banking industry that has seen players register huge growth in profit.  The group attributed the growth to a surge in customer transactions and a decline in loan impairment.  The bank’s profit grew to Sh4.66 billion over the six months, up from Sh2.63 billion over a similar period in 2020. Customer deposits reached Sh437 billion, a 12 per cent growth year on year.  The group’s asset base rose to Sh542 billion as of June this year, a six per cent increase year on year.    Absa profit jumps 833pc to Sh5.6 billion  Golf: Youngsters battle for Rome Classic slot  How banks doubled their profits in Covid-19 year   KCB half-year profit doubles to Sh15.3b on lower loan provision Loan impairments charges for the period stood at Sh5.9 billion, a decline of 22 per cent year on year from Sh7.63 billion in June last year.

We have made a concerted effort to reduce the risk in our credit portfolio while balancing the need to support our customers during this Covid-19 period,” said NCBA Group Managing Director John Gachora.  “Over the last year, we have taken the bold step to restructure 35 per cent of our credit portfolio and 82 per cent of that restructured portfolio is now performing.” The bank said it disbursed Sh272 billion in digital loans, a 16 per cent increase year on year.
