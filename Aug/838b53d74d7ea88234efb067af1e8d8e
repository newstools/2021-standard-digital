Treating of patients with Covid-19 complications in Homa Bay County got impetus after the county government put measures to address acute shortage of oxygen.  Homa Bay County Referral Hospital, the only health facility that offers Intensive Care Unit (ICU) services, has been suffering from shortage of oxygen since June.  But in an effort to salvage the situation, the county has established an oxygen tank with a capacity of 3,500 liters to address the matter.   The tank has been established at the hospital. Governor Cyprian Awiti, his deputy Hamilton Orata, Finance Executive Nicholas Koriko and his Water counterpart Dickson Nyawinda toured the hospital to supervise the project.

There are also 50 oxygen cylinders with a capacity of 4,500 litres which will be providing oxygen back up. Awiti said they will no longer seek support of oxygen from neighbouring counties such as Migori and Kisii.  Editorial: Full Capacity?  Raila, envoys hold talks on economy and Covid-19  Covid-19: Clerics criticize move to allow matatus to carry at full capacity  1,974 test positive for Covid-19 in Kenya in the last 24 hours He said the project will boost the fight against Covid-19 in the county. “Oxygen is critical for covid-19 patients,” Awiti said.    Ministry of Health receives 180,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine as a donation from Gov't of Greece  HEALTH WATCH: How Covid-19 misinformation worldwide has created panic by misleading masses  KEMRI makes a breakthrough in the fight against Covid-19 by developing a Virus Transport Media (VTM) By Kevine Omollo  | 9 hours ago By Stanley Ongwae | 17 hours ago By Kevine Omollo  | 22 hours ago By James Wanzala | 1 day ago
