Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen) has ruled out introducing power rationing in the country despite a drop in water levels at Masinga Dam. The State corporation noted that the dam, the country’s largest hydropower station, would run optimally throughout the year due to good hydrology.  The move follows reports that peak electricity demand had shot up from 1,661 megawatts (MW), at the height of Covid-19, to 1,994 MW as more industries resumed operations.  In a statement, the firm said water levels in Masinga that produce 40MW stood at 1054.17m above sea level (ASL) against a minimum operation of 1035m ASL.  “Masinga Dam is our biggest dam with a height of 1,056m Above Sea Level and will be able to run the hydropower plants optimally throughout the year,” KenGen said in a statement.  Estimated electricity bills are illegal, court tells Kenya Power  KenGen forced to modify hydropower projects to adapt to climate change  Ngong Hills wind power site the perfect place to unwind, enjoy cool breeze  KenGen starts drilling works on Ethiopia’s Sh7.6b second phase contract The power producer also noted that the highest peak demand recorded in the country stood at 1,994MW as more industries reopened.
