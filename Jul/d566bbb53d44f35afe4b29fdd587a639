The election of John Njuguna Wanjiku to represent Kiambaa for the remaining one year before the General Election has confounded many analysts. But there has been concurrence on one thing: That Wanjiku’s victory has exposed the long trek ahead for UDA’s patron, Deputy Prezzo Bill Ruto.  Why, after four years of campaigning, his candidate “only” managed a slim win with a paltry 500 votes between the UDA and Jubilee candidates. In fact, proponents of this view go on, if all the recipients of Ruto’s goodies lined up, here I am talking of church and youth groups that received stashes of cash in harambees, or barrows to start small businesses, they definitely would have surpassed the modest numbers who turned out to vote.  The other assessment is that barely 45 per cent of Kiambaa voters turned out to cast their ballot, but this is not unique either.  But there are some remarkable facts about the incoming MP: He is a real “hustler” who picked tea and coffee to augment his own school fees or family support, when he wasn’t roasting entrails and mutura in Kiambu townships.  For those who have forgotten, Kiambaa was previously represented by heavyweights such as Njenga Karume, possibly one of the richest men in this country, while the immediate former MP, Paul Koinange, was a scion of an influential Kiambu family.  Scramble for friendly parties ahead of 2022 polls  Five hurdles Ruto must overcome in race for State House next year  Hopes, fears as top leaders seek coalitions ahead of next year's race to State House  Ruto would have been kicked out of Jubilee by now, says Tuju The incoming MP’s surname is Wanjiku, evocative of the eponymous grassroots woman by the same name who gained popularity when politicians expressed their disdain for citizens’ participation in the Constitution-making process. That, too, is a major milestone.      Ruto asema katiba si lazima wakati huu, Kenya inahitaji kuboresha uchumi kuliko jambo lingine lolote  Karim Khan achukua kiapo cha afisi ya ICC, ana kibarua kikubwa kinachomsubiri  DP Ruto unhappy over reports that President Uhuru was backing plans for the revival of NASA outfit By Peter Kimani | 10 hours ago By Caroline Kibii | 12 hours ago By Peter Kimani | 20 hours ago By Editorial | 20 hours ago
