Siaya Senator James Orengo and Kenya National Focal Point on Small Arms and Light Weapons Deputy Director Charles Owino. [File, Standard]  Siaya gubernatorial aspirant Charles Owino has termed Siaya Senator James Orengo’s gubernatorial candidature a betrayal to ODM leader Raila Odinga’s 2022 State House bid.  Speaking during the burial in Siaya on Saturday, July 17, Owino said it was laughable that Orengo, a national politician, who is supposed to play a key role in Odinga’s campaigns ahead of 2022 polls was also interested in Siaya Governor seat.  “If Orengo believes Odinga is going to win the presidency, he must stick with him until he wins so that he can be the Attorney General or a Cabinet Secretary in that government,” said Owino.  The Kenya National Focal Point on Small Arms and Light Weapons deputy director said Orengo’s candidature will be a vote of no confidence against Odinga’s 2022 stab at the presidency and maybe fodder for his opponents.  Leaders seeking to succeed Rasanga call for fair primaries  Don’t stop BBI reggae as it is the people’s choice, Court of Appeal told  Haji asks court to lock out Orengo from Ojaamong's graft case  Raila in Kisumu to calm storms wreaking his backyard “Odinga’s opponents will use some of these moves to attack his candidature and show other people he is not in the race to win,” he added.  He challenged Orengo to tell Siaya locals why he is running for governor seat when he is one of the senior politicians from the region helping Raila in national politics.  “If he is coming to run for governor seat, he is sending a dangerous message about Raila’s 2022 bid, it is a message of betrayal.”  The former National Police spokesperson cautioned politicians who have expressed their interest in the Siaya governor seat to stop insulting each other and instead sell their agenda to the electorate.  “We should stop politics of name-calling and tell locals what we plan to them should we ascend to the seat.”  Owino in February announced he will be contesting for the Siaya Gubernatorial seat in 2022.  He said he is the best candidate for the job, adding that anyone who goes up against him will become irrelevant politically.  Owino hinted he could contest under the ODM ticket, a move that could complicate things for those jostling to succeed Governor Cornel Rasanga whose term is ending in August 2022.  Other politicians rumoured to be eying the seat include Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi, former Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo, Orengo among others.
