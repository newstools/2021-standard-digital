A pupil committed suicide in Gwassi Central in Homa Bay after his family rejected his decision to stop going to school.  The pupil at God Bura Primary School in Suba Sub-county reportedly went missing from home on Friday last week only for his body to be found dangling from a tree in a bush near his parents’ home at Kimoro village.  Area chief Winnie Onyango said: “The boy had been reluctant to join Standard Eight.
