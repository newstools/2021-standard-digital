This is even as the mystery of his disappearance deepened after the family claimed they had news he was alive, at an unknown location.    Speaking at their home in Meru on Saturday, Jane Gatwiri and Stephen Nkonge, said they had known no peace since Mbijjiwe, 43, went missing despite assurance from the Kenya Police Service that they were investigating the incident.  Inside mausoleum where politician Kenya will never forget is buried  Korir: Activism without facts won’t help Yego regain form   Photos: Kenyans shine at Stockholm Diamond League meeting  Blood cannot be manufactured, donate it “We have received reports that our son Mbijjiwe is very much alive. Therefore, as a family, we are requesting the Government to speed up their investigation and let us know his whereabouts,” she said.  She did not elaborate on the source of the information.  Nkonge said they had hit a brick wall in the three-week search for their son, and are now appealing to the US, Israel, and other nations with the capacity to trace him.  “Mbijjiwe is not your ordinary person who can just disappear. He is known at national and international levels. If the (Kenyan) government has been unable to track him they should seek help elsewhere,” he stated.   [Phares Mutembei]      Suspects Nabbed: Two suspects accused of kidnapping Hafsa Luqman arrested at dawn  Governor Charity Ngilu urges Kalonzo and Raila to mend fences and work together ahead of 2022 polls  Kenya yapokea msaada wa dozi 358,700 za chanjo dhidi ya virusi vya covid-19 kutoka nchini Denmark By  Joe Ombuor | 15 minutes ago By Brian Otieno | 3 hours ago By Amos Kareithi | 8 hours ago By Augustine Oduor | 8 hours ago
