President Uhuru Kenyatta is on a two-day tour of the larger Ukambani region. [File, Standard]  President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday, July 9 showered praise on ODM leader Raila Odinga and Wiper chief Kalonzo Musyoka as “forward-thinking” leaders.  Speaking in Makueni County on his first day of Ukambani tour, the President said unlike Odinga and Kalonzo, “other people were moving around the country dishing out cash to the youth and inciting Kenyans”. Kenyatta didn’t mention names of the people he adversely referred to.  Both Odinga and Kalonzo were with the Head of State at Thwake Dam, where he inspected the progress of the Sh82 billion project aimed at benefiting 1.3 million people.  “When Raila speaks, his remarks revolve around infrastructure. He understands the ingredients of transformation. I can say the same about Kalonzo. When he speaks, he limits his talk to infrastructure. The two are not moving around the country inciting Kenyans or engaging in a shouting match like other people,” he said.  President finally makes Ukambani tour  Olympics: President Uhuru presents Team Kenya with official travel kit  Covid-19 rules force Uhuru to commission city projects under the cover of darkness  Uhuru: Why I commissioned hospitals in Nairobi at night “When you stand to speak, don’t incite the youth.
