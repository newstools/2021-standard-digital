A family of 10 in Maella, Naivasha, is seeking justice after they were evicted from the house they had lived in since 1990.  Family members have been forced to spend the night out in the cold for the last one month as the land crisis in the clash-torn area came back to haunt members of the troubled Ng’ati Farm.  Last year, a task force formed by the Nakuru County government called for the revocation of some title deeds in the area.  The report further recommended that former directors of the land buying company be investigated over how they dished out parcels of the land to their cronies.  And months later, one of the families has been forced to spend the nights out in the cold after they were kicked out of their home by a trader in the area.  Investigators recover ‘black-box’ of aircraft that crashed in Naivasha  Churches caught in court battles over land affairs  Sue gets lost in dusty Vasha  ‘Vasha Vice Rally’ gives snapshot of our readiness to speed into sin   According to Njung’e Gacheru, he acquired the land from his father in 1990 and moved in with his family after acquiring all the documents from the land buying company.  A bitter Gacheru said that he had all the legal documents proving ownership of the plot and wondered how the other party got theirs.   Gacheru further accused some officials of working with the grabbers to deny him justice.      Uvuvi Haramu Naivasha: Wavuvi haramu wanatumia vifaa vibovu, baadhi ni neti zilizopigwa marufuku  Mwanamme ajaribu kujitoa uhai Naivasha, alikata koo kwa kigae cha chupa  Usafiri Naivasha: Imekuwa balaa kuingia na kutoka Naivasha baada ya barabara kukatika kwa wiki sasa By Bakari Angela | 2 hours ago By Robert Kiplagat  | 2 hours ago By Antony Gitonga | 1 day ago By Kamau Muthoni | 1 day ago
