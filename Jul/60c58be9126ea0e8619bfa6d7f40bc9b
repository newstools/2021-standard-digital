Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i has issued a seven-day ultimatum to herders occupying ranches in Laikipia County illegally to leave.  Dr Matiang’i has warned that failure to voluntarily leave will compel the government to conduct an operation to flush out the invaders.  The warning came amid complaints over pastoralists’ invasion of the ranches.  Respect for private property cannot be overemphasised. Marauding herders have no right to intrude on the ranches, except with express permission of the owners.  Matiang’i accuses some politicians of fuelling the conflict and the resultant insecurity that has plagued the area for decades. He must ensure that the illegal herders are evicted and those who incite them to trespass and cause havoc are arrested.  Matiang'i gives herders seven days to leave private ranches  Pastoralists invade private ranches for pasture as drought intensifies in Laikipia North  Pastoralists invade private ranches for pasture as drought intensifies in Laikipia North By Editorial | 12 hours ago By Editorial | 1 day ago By Editorial | 1 day ago By Editorial | 2 days ago
