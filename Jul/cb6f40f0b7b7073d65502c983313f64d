The fatal crash occurred in the wee hours of Wednesday, July 21. [Peterson Githaiga, Standard]  Four people died on the spot in the wee hours of Wednesday, July 21, after a 14-seater matatu they were travelling in rammed a stationary truck at Athi River in Machakos County.  Police said the commercial truck had stalled on the Mombasa-Nairobi highway, and the driver did not place any sign to warn other motorists.  The incident occurred right opposite Total Petrol Station in Athi River.    The matatu of registration plate KCN 289P, belonging to MAPTRA Sacco, was travelling to Nairobi from Machakos.  It remains unclear how many occupants were in the public service vehicle.  Athi River police boss, Anderson Njagi, confirmed the incident, saying the injured were taken to Athi River Shalom Community Hospital for medical attention.  Preliminary investigations indicate the matatu driver, who was among the injured, realised that the truck was stationary when it was too late to react appropriately.
