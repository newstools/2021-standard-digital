[Collins Kweyu, Standard]  Kuria, through his lawyer Geoffrey Omenke, said in January, this year, that he was pursuing an out-of-court settlement with Wanja, a political commentator and activist.  The MP had been accused of assaulting Wanja at the Inooro TV studios along Maalim Juma Road in Nairobi.  Wanja had claimed the MP, who is the leader of People Empowerment Party, descended on her with slaps and blows while she was preparing to go on air for Inooro TV 'Kirîrîmbi' show.  She recorded a statement at the Kilimani Police Station which led to Kuria being apprehended on January 10, 2020. He was later arraigned to face assault charges.  The magistrate directed Kuria's Sh20,000 cash bail be returned to him.
