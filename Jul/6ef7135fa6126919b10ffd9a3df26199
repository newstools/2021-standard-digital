The Ministry of ICT will relocate the fibre optic cable along the Nairobi-Mau Summit road to pave way for the construction of the Sh160 billion dual carriage that kicks off in September.   The road project is aimed at expanding the two-lane Nairobi to Mau Summit highway into a four-lane dual carriageway.  Addressing a stakeholder meeting on Wednesday in Kamandura, Limuru, ICT Principal Secretary Jerome Ochieng said the cable will be relocated permanently in the 240 kilometers that will be affected.  “It will take upto six weeks and there will be disruptions during the period,” Ochieng said.    Governor Waithaka refutes ICT ministry's claim on cables  Hackers threaten national security  Clock ticking on cable, power transformer vandals According to Ochieng, the relocation will cost Sh450 million and is part of efforts by government to ensure all major highways have all utilities including the fibre optic cable, sewerage and water.  “In the same way power lines will be relocated is the same for fibre optic cable since technology is also now part and parcel of our lives,” the PS said.  He said four companies have been contracted to do the job and complete within the set deadline.   “Once the relocation is complete the project will continue to deliver socioeconomic transformation and help develop a huge information highway from the heart of Kenya to the rest of the country,” he said.  The PS added that locals will be given priority in the job opportunities during the relocation. The 233-kilometre road construction contract was awarded to a French consortium and will see improvement of transport from eastern and western parts of Kenya.    By Collins Kweyu | 1 hour ago By PSCU | 2 hours ago By Saul Owiti | 2 hours ago By Patrick Wanjohi | 2 hours ago
