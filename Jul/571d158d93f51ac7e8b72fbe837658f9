The Likoni pedestrian footbridge at Liwatoni in Mombasa has slowed the spread of Covid-19 in the area, the government has said.  Mombasa County Commissioner Gilbert Kitiyo said yesterday the bridge was being used by at least 200,000 people daily since March this year and as a result, the infections had dropped.  “Although residents tried to resist using the bridge, it has become a game-changer as the number of people who stood close to each other as they waited for the ferries at Likoni has reduced,” said Kitiyo, who co-chairs the county Coronavirus Emergency Response committee.    Quoting statistics from Kenya Ferry Service and Kenya Ports Authority, Kitiyo said more than 100,000 people use the bridge in the morning and a similar number in the evening. Initially up to 350,000 people were using the ferries daily. Kitiyo spoke after meeting a delegation from Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC) and Kenya Film Classification Board (KFCB) seeking collaboration to fight inciters ahead of the electioneering period.  Improved efficiency cuts KPA earnings  Clergy pleads with KRA to release oxygen plant   Trying moments at border towns as coronavirus hits Uganda hard  France donates 182,400 Covid-19 vaccine doses  KFCB chief executive Ezekiel Mutua and KBC director Charles Mulila said they will fight those using social media to propagate hatred.      KEMRI makes a breakthrough in the fight against Covid-19 by developing a Virus Transport Media (VTM)  Nyanza clergy speak on Covid-19 guidelines imposed on the 13 counties  Janga la Covid-19: Wanafunzi nusu milioni hawakurejea shuleni baada ya likizo ndefu ya miezi tisa By Moses Nyamori | 10 hours ago By Philip Mwakio | 18 hours ago By Joackim Bwana | 18 hours ago By Moses Nyamori | 2 days ago
