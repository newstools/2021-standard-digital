Weldon Chepkwony denied a charge of obtaining money by false pretense. [Nikko Tanui, Standard]  A boda boda rider accused of attempting to extort Sh100,000 from his wife in a fake kidnap plot at Kabusenduk village in Bureti, Kericho, managed to con two other people who send him a total of Sh6,000.  Kericho Resident Magistrate Elizabeth Karani heard on July 6, the two sent Weldon Chepkwony Sh4,000 and Sh2,000 via Mpesa after the suspect called and told them he’d been kidnapped and his captors were demanding Sh100,000 ransom.  Chepkwony denied a charge of obtaining money by false pretense and was released on Sh100,00 bond and a surety of Sh50,000.  There was drama in court after Chepkwony’s lawyer Gordon Langat complained his client’s rights had been violated after he was arraigned more than 24 hours after arrest.  Some 150 students missing after gunmen raid Nigerian school –parent, administrator  Police net farmhand suspected to have killed 9-year-old girl  Families recount horror of their kin abducted in broad daylight  Gunmen kidnap staff, one-year-old baby from hospital The court, however, termed the complaint at the plea-taking stage as misplaced.  County Criminal Investigations Officer John Onyango, in his report, said Chepkwony was arrested after the investigators found him hiding at a friend’s house as he waited for his wife to send the money.  The suspect, in a bid to scare his wife into sending the money, reportedly claimed the kidnappers had bound his hands and were speeding to an unknown location.  Chepkwony’s host was freed after police established he was not involved in the scheme.  The case will be mentioned for pre trails on July 21.
