A day-old baby was yesterday rescued from an 80-feet pit latrine at Kamuiru village in Kirinyaga Central.  The owner of the latrine called the police and the fire brigade after hearing a baby cry from the latrine. County fire brigade boss John Kiama said the child, who was rescued at around 10am, was taken to Kerugoya Hospital where he is under observation.  The mother of the baby is yet to be known. "Many families are breaking up for lack of a baby boy when others are throwing them in toilets and rivers," said Kiama.     Waiguru's Sh80m home risks being attached over debt  Why counties need to access funds on time  Kirinyaga launches AI service to improve breeds  Man ties red ribbons around home before killing mother in Kirinyaga   Zaidi ya wafanyabiashara 300 kunufaika Kirinyaga, Mrundiko wa Kesi | MBIU YA KTN (Sehemu ya Pili)  Coffee farmers from Kirinyaga county set to benefit from value-addition machines  Kirinyaga & Narok listed as counties with most opaque budgets after scoring zero points in survey By Ndung’u Gachane and Phares Mutembei | 2 hours ago By Hudson Gumbihi | 10 hours ago By Nderitu Gichure | 18 hours ago By Fidelis Kabunyi | 2 days ago
