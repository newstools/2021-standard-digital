The court heard that Odhiambo killed Flora Nyangweso in her homestead in Pala Boya sub-location, Ndhiwa sub-County, on August 18, 2013.  Odhiambo, 40, disappeared for three years after killing Flora but was arrested and charged after being found at a village in the neighbouring Suba sub-County in 2015.
