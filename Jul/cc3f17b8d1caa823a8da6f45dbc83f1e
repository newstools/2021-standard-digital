Pope Francis appeared in public on Sunday for the first time since undergoing intestinal surgery a week ago, stepping out on a balcony at Rome's Gemelli hospital to lead his weekly prayer before hundreds of people.  The Pope is continuing a normal recovery from intestinal surgery, gradually resuming work, walking and eating with aides.  The 84-year-old Pope was in hospital after undergoing a three-hour operation to remove part of his colon, which the Vatican said had narrowed severely.    It is the first time Pope Francis has been hospitalised since he became pope in 2013.  Pope Francis doing well after intestinal surgery, Vatican says  Pope Francis in hospital for intestinal surgery  Blinken and pope hold talks at Vatican in wake of bishops' ruling  Pope changes Church law to enshrine roles for women ....
