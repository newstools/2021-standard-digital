Police found the bodies of the two children on Tuesday, July 13, 2021. [File, Standard]  Two children aged below 10, who went missing in Buruburu, Nairobi, on June 30 and July 1, have been found dead.  Bodies of the boy and girl were on Tuesday night, July 13, found dumped in a thicket in Spring Valley in Westlands, Nairobi.  A key suspect in the abductions and murders has been arrested.  Police told The Standard the suspect, who was traced to his rented house in Kitengela, Kajiado County, led detectives from the criminal intelligence and special service units to the scene, where the minors’ bodies had been dumped.  “Investigations indicate the children were kidnapped from Buruburu and murdered after failed ransom demands,” a DCI officer stationed at Gigiri said.  Police officers from the Spring Valley took the children’s bodies to a Nairobi morgue, awaiting post-mortem.
