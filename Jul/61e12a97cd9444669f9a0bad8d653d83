The Tigray conflict that began on November 4, 2020 as a retaliatory attack on Tigray People Liberation Front (TPLF) shows no sign of abating.  According to Amnesty International and US government intelligence reports, the fighting has occasioned massive food shortages, death and untold suffering to innocent civilians caught in the crossfire between TPLF and Ethiopian Army. Thousands of refugees have crossed over to Sudan in search of peace, but that does not help their situation.  Both sides of the conflict seem to have dug in, which has denied constructive dialogue a chance to resolve the conflict. Time has come for regional powers to step in and stop the conflict.  The African Union and Inter Governmental Authority for Development should intervene and bring this conflict to an end.     Forces from Ethiopia's Tigray region say they are pushing south  How Abiy let his ambition blind him to reality of Horn of Africa  UN Security Council asks member states to pile pressure for ceasefire in Ethiopia  Tigray's former rulers back in Mekelle, Ethiopian government declares ceasefire By Editorial | 6 hours ago By Editorial | 2 days ago By Editorial | 2 days ago By Editorial | 5 days ago
