Lawyer John Khaminwa has offered to represent in court police officer Caroline Kangogo if she surrenders to the police.  Mr Khaminwa has at the same time said he will move to court to seek orders stopping Kangogo’s arrest to give her an opportunity to turn herself in.  But the senior counsel attached some conditions to this goodwill gesture.  Kangogo must surrender the weapons she is said to be in possession of to the police or to any of Khaminwa’s law firm offices. “We urge her to surrender. We (Khaminwa’s law firm) are ready and willing to represent her in court until any matter arising is heard and determined,” Khaminwa (above) told The Standard on phone.    Businessman who shot woman ‘mistaken’ for Caroline Kangogo released on bail  The perils of low-trust society and why fakes will be the death of us  Police clueless on Kangogo's whereabouts five days later  Editorial: Beware, the hunt is on The search for the missing cop entered day eight yesterday.
