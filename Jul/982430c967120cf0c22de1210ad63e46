The driver of the ill-fated truck drove into Ndhiwa Police Station after the accident to avoid being attack by angry locals. [James Omoro, Standard]  A 23-year-old woman carrying a three-year-old child died on the spot on Monday, July 5 after being struck by a speeding truck while the child escaped death in a road accident in Ndhiwa town, Homa Bay county.  Sharon Otieno and her daughter were knocked by a speeding truck along Sori – Rodi Kopany Road.  The woman was reportedly trekking on the pedestrian path towards Rodi Kopany with the child on her chest when she was hit from behind and sent flying before landing by the roadside.  “She carried the baby on her chest when the truck suddenly knocked and threw her a distance,” a witness told The Standard.  The woman sustained head injuries and died at the scene while the child escaped with minor head bruises and was rushed to Ndhiwa Sub-county hospital.  She died at the scene before well-wishers could take her to the nearby hospital.”  The deceased’s body was moved to Manyatta Kobodo mortuary.  While confirming the incident, Ndhiwa Sub County Police commander Robert Aboki said the driver of the truck has been arrested.  “The driver drove to Ndhiwa Police Station to escape mob justice in Ndhiwa town.
