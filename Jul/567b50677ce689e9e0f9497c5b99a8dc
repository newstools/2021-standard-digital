A section of the Political leaders allied to the ' Hustler Nation' during a presser at the Parliament buildings.[Elvis Ogina,Standard]  I agree with a decision by Africa Court on Human and People’s Rights that countries are at liberty to call off an election if there is an emergency or a health crisis.   The Covid-19 pandemic that we are battling as a nation and the region is no joke.   We have lost many lives and it will be counter-intuitive for us to lose more lives simply because of a general election.   Lives can't be replaced, but elections come and go all the time. In Kenya, we have seen areas where political meetings and rallies and other public events have been held, register a spike in new Covid-19 cases.  How Kenya’s politics risks being overrun by big money  The good, bad and the ugly of IEBC recruitment  Trade unions should take keen interest in general election  Ruto, Mudavadi storm central in search of votes A good example is Kisumu where a large number of people were infected after it hosted the Madaraka Day event with no adherence to health protocols.   I am sure we all don't desire to have a repeat of the same in 2022. It will be very difficult for Kenyans to obey Covid-19 protocols during the campaigns.  Elections are not a matter of life and death. Let's safeguard the lives of Kenyans.    Uhuru vs Judiciary: High Court deals the president another blow by quashing Uhuru's Executive order  Dr. Mukhisa Kituyi's take on the war between the Executive vs Judiciary & the troubled Mumias  War pitting the Executive and the Judiciary has escalated after the 2017 general elections By Editorial | 22 hours ago By Phillip Mbithi and Lillian Matemu  | 22 hours ago By Wilson Sossion | 22 hours ago By Charles Onyango | 1 day ago
