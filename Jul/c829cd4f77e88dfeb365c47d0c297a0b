President Uhuru Kenyatta on Thursday morning met his French host Emmanuel Macron at Elysee Palace in Paris during which the leaders discussed several bilateral and multilateral subjects of mutual interest to Kenya and France.  President Kenyatta and his French host discussed the progress of key France supported infrastructure projects in Kenya including the expansion of the 233-kilometre Rironi-Nakuru-Mau Summit Road whose construction is set to kick-off in September this year.  The public-private partnership (PPP) agreement to expand the Northern Corridor road into a four-lane dual carriageway and reduce congestion at a cost of Sh160 billion was reached during President Kenyatta's visit to Paris in October last year.  Besides infrastructure, Presidents Kenyatta and Macron discussed enhanced cooperation in the health sector particularly in building Kenya's capacity to manufacture vaccines locally.  On the multilateral front, the two leaders spoke about the forthcoming Global Partnership for Education (GPE) Summit in London to be co-hosted by President Kenyatta and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.  7pm-4am curfew in 13 counties to remain until July 31: Uhuru  Uhuru visits injured KDF soldiers as DoD remains tightlipped on details   Uhuru, Raila mourn death of Mama Dorcas Ntimama  Is Uhuru’s war on drugs in Coast bearing fruit?
