Rescuers in Japan searched desperately on Monday for survivors among 80 people believed to be still missing two days after landslides tore through the seaside city of Atami, destroying houses and burying roads under mud and rock.  According to CNN reports, two days ago, a devastating "tsunami" of mud swept through a coastal city, killing at least three people.  Expert reports indicate that the powerful mudslide in Atami, Shizuoka prefecture, about 90 kilometres (56 miles) southwest of Tokyo, was triggered by torrential rains.  Videos posted on social media showed a deluge of black water crash down a mountain and into the city, destroying homes in its path.  Tokyo may extend Covid-19 curbs into Olympics period  Uganda team coach arriving in Tokyo had Delta coronavirus variant  Top court rules couples must use the same surname  One of Uganda's Olympic squad tests positive for coronavirus on arrival in Japan  Rescue efforts have been stepped up throughout the weekend, with police, firefighters and members of the Japan Self-Defense Forces joining the operations.
