Lolonyokwe said the police are investigating circumstances around the killing.  He called on riders to obey set curfew protocols to avoid falling prey to criminals.  ''It's true, one of the riders was murdered last night. We are, however, appealing to the riders to give us chance so that we can investigate and get to know who killed him; two wrongs don't make a right. We agreed with the riders that they should not operate beyond curfew time, this will help reduce the criminal activities,'' said Loronyokwe.
