Deputy President Willliam Ruto bids farewell to Pastor Dennis Nthumbi of New Breed City Chapel after attending a church fundraiser.[Fidelis Kabunyi,Standard]  It is clear for everyone to see that the fight against corruption in Kenya has been politicised.  Our criminal justice system has unfortunately been politicised and it is being used to victimise those that have supported Deputy President William Ruto.   I agree with Dr Ruto that a number of leaders associated with him have been targeted by authorities simply because of being allied with him.  It is not a coincidence that majority of politicians that have been dragged to court or are currently being investigated support the DP.  JB Muturi will be a formidable force in 2022 polls and beyond  Munyithya proposes reforms as he eyes IEBC job  Yeah, elections are next year, but digital youth just don’t care  IEBC issues tenders for 2022 election materials The fact that most of the cases have dragged on for long without being prosecuted proves that it’s all witch-hunt and political persecution.   The leaders are being punished for supporting Ruto. It is wrong to use government agencies to punish and settle political scores with people you don’t agree with.  I am however happy that Ruto has over the years proved to be a strong man despite the war against him. As we head to 2022, the war waged against him will even be more fierce.
