Four people were today afternoon burnt beyond recognition in Bomokona village, Marani over suspicion of being witches.  Marani Sub County Deputy County Commissioner Patrick Muriira said all the four victims were women aged over 70. They were suspected of having bewitched a Form Two student.  According to the police, the student was suddenly unable speak and villagers opted to initiate a process to identify the witches.  The student is said to have gained back his voice and named the four. This forced the irate villagers to storm each of the homes, killing them.  Villager's shock as man’s mutilated body found dumped in river  Kenyan female athletes conquer the world but suffer at home  Suspected child killer Masten Wanjala is dead  Ruiru suspected serial killer says he attended victims' funerals Police have arrested four suspects in connection with the lynching of the grannies.  “We can't have a society that believes in witchcraft and mob justice.

The killing of the four is just a statistic in the rising number of mob lynchings of elderly women who are said to engage in what villagers term as "black magic" in Kisii and Nyamira counties.     Murder Mystery: FBI joins investigations into the disappearance & murder of Bashir Mohammed  Police detain a couple and their son for allegedly beating their 15-year-old daughter to death  Nyeri Murder Probe: Nyeri tycoon accused of killing his own son over domestic quarrel between them By Nathan Ochunge | 4 hours ago By Jael Mboga | 15 hours ago By James Omoro | 17 hours ago By Benard Lusigi | 1 day ago
