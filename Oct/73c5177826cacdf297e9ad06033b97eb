Health workers staged a demonstration protesting neglect and poor working conditions.   They have accused Governor Martin Wambora and the County Public Service Board of failing to address their grievances as their strike entered the second week.  They said the two offices failed to heed their complaints, ranging from non-remittance of statutory deductions, partial payment of salaries, shortage of staff and insufficient drugs and equipment in health facilities.  Embu Deputy Governor David Kariuki said they had engaged the union, and that there was a possibility of a truce. “There is goodwill. The strike will be over on Thursday,” he said.  But the health workers have vowed to continue with the strike. Kenya National Union of Nurses, Embu Branch Secretary, Macharia Kanderi, said deductions, including NHIF, PAYE, and bank loans were not remitted for the last four months. “Our colleagues cannot enjoy the benefits of NHIF cover as the records are not up to date," said Macharia.  Devolution conference to take place next month  Governors propose additional funds, set new dates for devolution conference  CoG wants more funds disbursed to counties in 2022/2023 Financial Year  Embu Court acquits two murder suspects    Governor Martin Wambora locked horns with members of the Senate health committee over Covid funds  Utata wa Ardhi Embu: Viongozi walaani ubomoaji huku maelfu wakiachwa bila makao  Nabbed for Sodomy: Police in Embu hold paedophile suspect after he allegedly defiled nephew aged 12 By Wainaina Ndung’u | 6 hours ago By Jane Mugambi | 6 hours ago By Timothy Kariuki | 6 hours ago By Fidelis Kabunyi | 16 hours ago
