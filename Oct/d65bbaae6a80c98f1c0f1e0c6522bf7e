A Machakos man suspected to have killed his wife by stabbing her six times after allegedly finding her with another man in their house has surrendered to the police.  Andrew Mutiso, 28, who disappeared after the October 21 incident showed up at Athi River Police Station on Sunday accompanied by two of his brothers.   A Manhunt for Mutiso had been launched yesterday, after his wife's dead body was found in their house by concerned Nyumba Kumi members, two days after she went missing.  Shocked by the horrifying scene, neighbours who were privy to the heated scuffle that ensued between Mutiso and his wife on Thursday night when he found another man in bed with his wife, alerted the police of the body.  Alfred Mutua opens up on Boniface Mwangi beef, marital split and State House  Athi River and its contaminated vegetables   Five Wiper ward reps in trouble for visiting DP William Ruto  MCAs seek to review cooperatives law to revive coffee sector Crime scene detectives from Kitengela processed the scene before the body was moved to a local hospital morgue for autopsy.
