Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has hit out at Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka claiming he is no longer the undisputed Kamba kingpin.  Dr Mutua said Wiper’s loss at Nguu/Masumba Ward by-election was an indication that Kalonzo was no longer the person to talk on behalf of Ukambani region.  “I respect Stephen Kalonzo Musyoka and I call all my supporters to be respectful. However, he needs to be politely reminded that the Nguu/Masumba Ward by-election has shown that over 76 per cent of voters rejected him and Wiper. That is the current status,” said Mutua.  “I wish to inform all political and development players that the Kamba Nation has awoken up from selfish leadership and we have shifted our alliance from the politics of poverty to politics of development,” he added.  The second term governor said it was time for change in Ukambani, claiming that for the over 30 years that the Kamba nation has politically been under Kalonzo's leadership, he has never seized this opportunity to initiate development or empower people.    Objectivity or Opportunity?
