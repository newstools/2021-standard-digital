TSC chief executive Nancy Macharia has warned school heads against hiring de-registered teachers. [File, Standard]  The Teachers Service Commission (TSC) has de-registered 43 teachers for various professional misconducts and warns private and public schools against hiring them.  In a Gazette Notice dated October 22, TSC chief executive Nancy Macharia said the affected teachers will immediately cease from being bonafide teachers.   “In exercise of powers conferred by section 30 (1) (e) of the Teachers Service Commission Act, the Commission wishes to notify the public that the persons whose names are specified in the Schedule herein below have been removed from the Register of Teachers,” Macharia said in the notice.  Macharia has also warned heads of learning institutions against employing the removed teachers they risk being jailed.  Guardian sues TSC, says student died from corporal beating  Court allows teacher training to continue as case goes to hearing  Court declines to suspend teachers’ mandatory training  TSC all set to roll out new refresher courses “It is against the law to employ in any school a person not being a registered teacher and the school heads found doing that shall be liable to a fine of not less than Sh100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to both,” she said in the notice.  According to TSC Act section 30 (4) and (5) and section 23, a teacher removed from the register shall not be reinstated except by the direction of the Commission.  The Acts also state that the affected individuals cease to be teachers with effect from the date of such removal and are not authorised to engage in the teaching service unless such a person is re-registered as a teacher by TSC.  In May 2021, another 52 teachers lost their job after being de-registered over indiscipline cases while in November 2020, another 50 were fired over the same.
