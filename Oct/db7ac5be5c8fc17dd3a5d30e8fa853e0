Detectives based in Nyali, Mombasa County have launched investigations into an incident where a 25-year-old woman was murdered on Monday, October 4 at 3 am.  According to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), the suspect who is believed to be a foreigner, allegedly threw the woman from the balcony of their Sunny Side Apartments before fleeing from the scene.  “A guard at the apartment was on the beat walking around his area of assignment when he heard delirious screams of a woman from the skies, followed by loud bang metres from where he was standing,” DCI said.  Reports indicate that the two were involved in an intimate relationship.  Woman wants man who defiled, killed her daughter, 12, to be given harsher sentence  Nakuru woman recalls daughter's last days in murder trial testimony  Embu Court acquits two murder suspects  Witness in murder of former prison warder places suspect in area where body was found After the security guard discovered an unknown body lying in a pool of blood, he informed the janitors who quickly identified the young woman.  “Together, they visited the scene and established that the lifeless body belonged to a 25-year-old woman, who had earlier in the night been invited to room A10, by a man named Muyanga Suleiman,” the sleuths added.
