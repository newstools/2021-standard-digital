President Uhuru Kenyatta has joined Kenya's athletics fraternity in mourning Olympian Agnes Jebet Tirop who was found dead in her house in Iten town, Elgeyo Marakwet County on Wednesday.  Agnes Tirop, 25, was part of the triumphant Kenyan contingent to this year's delayed 2020 Tokyo Olympics where she represented the country in the 5,000m race and finished 4th in the final.  In a message of condolence and comfort to the family, friends, relatives, and the athletics fraternity, the President mourned Agnes as a Kenyan hero and champion whose death is a big blow to the country's sporting ambitions and profile.  "It is unsettling, utterly unfortunate and very sad that we've lost a young and promising athlete who, at a young age of 25 years, she had brought our country so much glory through her exploits on the global athletics stage including in this year's 2020 Tokyo Olympics where she was part of the Kenyan team in Japan," the President eulogised.  Agnes Tirop: Final moments of slain Kenyan athlete  Tirop death lifts lid on female athletes’ woes  What you should know about Agnes Tirop  Kenyan athlete Agnes Tirop found dead "It is even more painful that Agnes, a Kenyan hero by all measures, painfully lost her young life through a criminal act perpetuated by selfish and cowardly people," the President said, and directed the police to hasten the search and apprehension of the athlete's killers.
