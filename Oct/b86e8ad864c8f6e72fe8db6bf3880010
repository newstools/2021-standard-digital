Thousands of land title deeds are ready to be handed over to residents of Trans Nzoia County.  Rift Valley Regional Commissioner George Natembeya said the national government is committed to fast-tracking the distribution of the documents to address frequent land feuds.  Mr Natembeya (pictured) blamed delays in the distribution of the land ownership documents on the Covid-19 pandemic. “At least 10,000 have been processed and ready for distribution. The Head of State will hand them to residents,” he said.  He said that many farms in the county lack title deeds, which results in land invasion. “The government will distribute the title deeds to end the persistent land conflicts that have been witnessed in the region over the years.”  He urged residents with land suits in court to consider alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.   Bill to ensure public open spaces get title deeds to avert grabbing  Nairobi public open spaces to get title deeds to avert grabbing  Ministry issues 400,000 title deeds in one year  Coast residents in last-minute rush to file land claim papers  YARA out to boost food security, over 2500 farmers set to benefit  President Uhuru set to issue 10,000 title deeds in Nakuru county  Suluhu yatafutwa kuhusu umiliki wa Ardhi Lamu By Kennedy Gachuhi | 10 hours ago By Lynn Kolongei | 10 hours ago By Paul Ogemba | 17 hours ago By Daniel Chege and Julius Chepkwony | 1 day ago
