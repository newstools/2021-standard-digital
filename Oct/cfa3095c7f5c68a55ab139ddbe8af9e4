[Reuters]  Nigeria will require civil servants to show proof of vaccination against Covid-19 or a negative test for the disease to gain access to their offices from the beginning of December, a presidential committee said on Wednesday.  The presidential committee said unvaccinated government workers will need to present a negative test result done within 72-hours before they are granted access to their offices across the country and its embassies abroad.  "An appropriate service-wide advisory/circular will be issued to guide the process," Boss Mustapha, chairman of the presidential steering committee on Covid-19, said in a statement.
