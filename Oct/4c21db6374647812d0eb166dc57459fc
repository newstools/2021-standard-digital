A dormitory at Buruburu Girls Secondary School in Nairobi is on fire.  Screaming students were seen escaping through the windows as smoke engulfed the building.  Eyewitness Diana Mwangangi has told The Standard that she rushed to the scene after she heard students screaming for help from the school.  “It is scary, I saw students jumping from as high as the third floor as the smoke billowed from the other side of the building,” she said.  Mwangangi who left the scene after reportedly alerting other people said the guards at the gate blocked people from entering the school compound.  "I left the scene, but I could hear fire engine sirens at the scene."  Confirming the incident, Buruburu Sub-County Police Commander Francis Kamau said firefighters were at the scene.  He, however, said they can still not know if some students are trapped in the burning dormitory.  "Officers and firefighters are at the schools, but it is still too early to know what happened or the extent of the damage,” he told The Standard on phone.  Injured students were rushed to the nearby Metropolitan Hospital.  The fire started at around 5pm.  The cause of the fire was not immediately established     More to follow…  By Mireri Junior | 9 hours ago By Mireri Junior | 10 hours ago By Winfrey Owino | 17 hours ago By Josphat Thiong'o | 22 hours ago
