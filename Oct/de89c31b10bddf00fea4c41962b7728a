Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla has said India considers its relationship with the US to be of paramount importance not only for the two countries but also for ensuring a free, open and prosperous Indo-Pacific region.  The Deccan Chronicle last week reported that Shringla spoke at the US-India Business Council (USIBC) India Ideas Summit. The two-day 2021 India Ideas Summit began on Wednesday.  He said there is every reason to believe that the bilateral relationship will only attain greater heights in years to come.  "India considers its relationship with the US to be of paramount importance, not only for our respective nations but also in ensuring a free, open and prosperous Indo-Pacific region, and a peaceful and prosperous world," the Deccan Chronicle reported Shringla saying.  Britain urges caution over Huawei role in 5G network  UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson quits  UK diplomat bashed for congratulating Kenyatta   World leaders react to Mugabe ouster "There is every reason to believe that India-US relationship will only attain greater heights in years to come.
