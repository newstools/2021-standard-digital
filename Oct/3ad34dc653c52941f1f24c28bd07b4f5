The project is sponsored by the Ministry of Education and the United Nations Children’s Fund.  The target group is children between six and 13 years of age from Turkana, Bungoma, Wajir, West Pokot, Samburu, Tana River, Kwale, Marsabit, Mandera, Isiolo and Garissa counties.  The ravages of nature, poverty, outdated cultural mores and negative human activities like cattle rustling and banditry often leave children in these counties disadvantaged in terms of acquiring education, yet education is the greatest equaliser of all time. This programme will offer children from humble backgrounds a fair shot at life through education. This scheme, a continuation of ‘Operation-Come-to-School’ that benefited 350 000 pupils between 2015 and 2019 is a timely boost for the push to eradicate illiteracy.     Shock of counties with 1.8m missing school children  Sh17 billion capitation for schools released  Time to rethink how CBC system is being enacted  Yes, crack the whip on school heads flouting fee guidelines  Digital Form One selection concluded across the country, students will report on the 2nd of August  CS Magoha assures Kenyans of Integrity in the Form One selection exercise set to begin this week  Education CS Professor George Magoha out in Nakuru to ensure 100% transition By Editorial | 8 hours ago By Editorial | 1 day ago By Editorial | 1 day ago By Editorial | 2 days ago
