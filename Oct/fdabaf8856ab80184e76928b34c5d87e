Judge’s gavel [Courtesy]  A Milimani court has ruled that a man who pleaded guilty to killing his former wife is not fit to stand trial.  Stephen Nyangeri Mauti, 25, who was arraigned before Senior Principal Magistrate Bernard Ochoi, had admitted to killing Faith Nyatichi on October 3 at Kangemi dam side in Nairobi.  Ochoi had ordered the accused to be taken for a mental assessment at Mathari National Teaching and Referral Hospital and be presented in court on Monday for his sentencing.  On Monday, the prosecution had still not received a report from the mental hospital and Ochoi moved the sentencing to yesterday.   Trader, firm charged with Sh6.2m fraud  Woman who faked pregnancy arraigned in court   Man handed life sentence for sodomising six-year-old daughter  Indian in court for stealing shares worth Sh100m Following the ruling, the prosecution asked the court for one more month to enable the accused go through a mental assessment before he is sentenced.  Mauti is, however, asking for forgiveness.  "Your honour, I have filed with the High Court to have me forgiven. I have even talked to the family of the deceased to forgive me for the offense," he said.  Mauti said he had discovered that his former wife was living with another man after they separated.
