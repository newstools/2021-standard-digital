Kenyans will be watching keenly how the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) conducts the ongoing registration exercise. This is a critical undertaking ahead of the 2022 General Election.  Previously, IEBC bore greater blame for the shortcomings that dented the credibility of the elections. It would, however, be unfair to overlook the aspect of political interference, but more importantly, IEBC’s lack of resources to conduct credible elections.  Our electoral experience tells us we cannot afford a misstep. IEBC has requested more funding to conduct a successful voter registration in order not to disenfranchise eligible voters. While the government should see to that, IEBC has a duty to ensure the funds are used prudently, and every dime accounted for. Credible elections are a key ingredient of democracy. That State has an obligation to ensure IEBC succeeds.        Electoral agency accuses Court of Appeal of using non-existent law on BBI verdict  Special Report: How election materials tenders create eating orgies  How ban on donor funding will affect 2022 general election   State spends Sh2.5b on legal fees as cost burden piles on taxpayers  ODM’s attempt to oust Chebukati from IEBC elicits mixed reactions | INSIDE POLITICS WITH BEN KITILI  IEBC launches 2020-2024 Strategic Plan ahead of the 2022 general elections  Uteuzi wa kidato cha kwanza, IEBC imezindua ruwaza na mikakati ya miaka mitano ijayo | MBIU YA KTN By Editorial | 9 hours ago By Editorial | 1 day ago By Editorial | 2 days ago By Editorials | 3 days ago
