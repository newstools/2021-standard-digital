Members of the County Assembly have passed a Motion to compel the Executive to stop the registration of community land in Taita Taveta.  The Deputy Majority Party Leader Abraham Juma had raised questions on the registration process, saying it was not transparent. Juma had said that the mandatory public participation was not conducted before the exercise started.  “This assembly urges the county executive to stop the registration of community land until the process of documentation, mapping, community engagement and developing of the inventory of the land is duly completed,” stated the Motion that the MCAs overwhelmingly approved in a session chaired by temporary Speaker, Mata Ward Representative Chanzu Khamadi. Juma said any unregistered community land should be held in trust by the county government on behalf of the communities.  The Kasigau Ward Rep claimed several unregistered parcels of land were at the risk of being grabbed if the exercise was not carried out in a transparent manner.    MCAs summon water CEC over Sh859 million grant   Two firms ordered to open joint account in Sh460m land battle   MCAs pass motion for county to establish mental health policy  MCAs query poor state of early childhood centres, hefty pay in Taita Taveta     Wakazi Kajiado wahimizwa kula matunda, Ukataji miti Taita Taveta, Yuko wapi Nkatha? | MBIU YA KTN  Taita Taveta County and National Government collaborate in drug administration in the county  Muslim faithful in Taita Taveta county share expectations on this year's Ramadhan celebrations By Philip Mwakio | 1 day ago By  Ernest Ndunda | 2 days ago By Joackim Bwana | 2 days ago By Joackim Bwana | 2 days ago
