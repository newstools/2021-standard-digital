Police in Homa Bay County are looking for a driver and turn boy who were transporting 7,800 crates of eggs from Uganda.  The police have impounded the lorry, and eggs worth Sh2.7 million. The vehicle was first spotted in Mbita town.   A team of police officers set up a roadblock to intercept it near Rodi Kopany township.  The driver and his colleague disappeared into the bushes.  Homa Bay County DCI officer Abed Kavoo said the eggs were brought into Kenya illegally.  Cement manufacturers escalate dispute over clinker import tax  New payments system to boost continental trade  Port managers in a spot as DCI probes container smuggling  State bars millers from importing wheat, prices up to Sh3,700 per bag “It seemed the driver knew he was in an illegal business and that is why he could not stop the lorry for security check in Mbita,” Kavoo said.   He said the goods lacked approval documents.  “They used shortcuts. We are still looking for them so they can face the law,” said Kavoo.  The DCI officer said registration of the vehicle at the National Transport and Safety Authority showed the owner is a resident of South Nyanza.  “We suspect the eggs were being ferried to one of the South Nyanza counties,” Kavoo said.
