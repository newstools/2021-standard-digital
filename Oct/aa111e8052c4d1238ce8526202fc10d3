Detectives are awaiting a postmortem report to establish the cause of death of a Nakuru businessman whose body was found inside his car at the Lake Nakuru National Park.  The test on the body of Daniel Mwangi Maitha, 39, and who dealt in farm inputs, will be conducted today at Rift Valley Provincial General Hospital, according to Benson Mutie, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations in Nakuru.  Mr Mutie said Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) officers patrolling the park found Mwangi’s body as well as bottles of insecticides and alcoholic drinks in his car on Saturday at about noon.  “We visited the scene and found the car with the engine still running. We accessed the car through one of the windows and found the man dead,” said Mutie. He said two five 500ml bottles of an insecticide were inside the car, one empty and the other three-quarters full.  According to the detectives, Mwangi checked in on Friday, through the Lanet gate at around 11am. “The KWS officers found his vehicle at around noon on Saturday,” said Mutie.  KWS appeals for help in tracing missing warden  Inside Kenya’s wildlife census  Nakuru family demands answers on disappearance of KWS officer  Nakuru family in agony as KWS detective goes missing A photo of Mwangi’s body at the scene of crime circulated on social media on Sunday.
