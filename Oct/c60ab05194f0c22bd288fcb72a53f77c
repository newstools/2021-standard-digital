Alcoholic drinks are some of the most counterfeited goods in Meru and surrounding counties, a senior Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) official has said.  Deputy Commissioner Nicholas Kinoti, who is in charge of Meru and 11 other counties, said illegal traders have infiltrated fast moving products.  Kinoti, who spoke during a tree planting exercise at Chugu Secondary School in Imenti North, said KRA and other State agencies have launched a campaign against counterfeit products as part of efforts to facilitate the achievement of the Big Four Agenda.  The goods, he said, caused unfair competition to those doing legitimate business, and had deprived KRA of revenue. “Our biggest problem is in liquor. People legally doing business cannot compete with those supplying unapproved products.”     Uhuru seeks end to judicial activism in KRA’s tax collection  Anne Kananu seeks to stop arrest over Sh3.4 billion tax dispute  List: All 17 companies awarded by President Uhuru for exemplary tax compliance  Kananu snubs DCI summons over City Hall's Sh2.1bn tax arrears  War on Counterfeits: KRA officers sieze more than 30,000 litres of opaque beer in Embu county  KRA yakusanya shilingi 200B katika mwaka wa 2020; ni kiasi kikubwa kinyume na matarajio  Taxes & Small enterprises, discussion with experts from KRA | KTN News Special | Part 2 By Patrick Alushula | 3 hours ago By Rashid Lolrogoi | 3 hours ago By Elvince Joshua | 22 hours ago By Patrick Muinde | 23 hours ago
