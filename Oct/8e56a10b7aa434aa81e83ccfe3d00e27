Poster of lost child [Courtesy]  A family is in agony after their four-year-old boy went missing under unclear circumstances more than a month ago.  The minor, identified as Lucky Mathew, had on September 20, gone to the shops with his elder brother in Chepsonoi along Kapsabet-Kakamega road only to disappear without a trace.  Monica Jelimo, the boy's mother, said she had sent her 18-year-old son Owen Ndieke to buy vegetables at the nearby market. She was shocked when Ndieke returned 30 minutes later without Mathew.  “When I asked where his baby brother was, Ndieke told me that Mathew returned home on the way. I was a bit surprised since the shops are less than 500 metres away. I didn’t expect him to get lost,” she said.  Police pursue man linked to girlfriend's death after attack over love triangle   Six decades on, Koru-Soin dam project remains locals' dream  Help!
