Police in Samburu County have recovered an M-16 rifle with 25 rounds of ammunition at Longewan village.  One person was also killed following an exchange of fire between bandits and security personnel in the area, authorities said.  Samburu Police Commander Samson Ogelo said the bandits, who had stolen livestock from the village, were pursued by officers from the Anti-Stock Theft Unit (ASTU) before engaging them in a gunfight for nearly four hours.  "The police overpowered them, killing one and forcing the others to flee,” said Mr Ogelo, adding that officers recovered 27 cows.    Samburu-Pokot leaders in bid to end hostilities  Bandits in Samburu shoot dead father and son in daring raid  Ballistics squad detonates abandoned bomb in Samburu  Four killed as cattle rustlers raid Samburu village The police boss said the bandits were suspected to have migrated from Laikipia County following an intense security operation in the region.  Ogelo said ASTU officers were pursuing the rustlers, and warned those engaging in the business of cattle theft that their days were numbered.  The killing of the bandit and recovery of the rifle comes days after leaders from Samburu and Baringo launched an initiative to promote peace along their common border.  This is after five people were shot dead, several others injured and an unknown number of livestock stolen in three separate attacks at Morijo and Porro areas in the span of one week.
