Silhouette of handicapped Man sitting on wheelchair [Courtesy]  Parliament’s Health Committee met Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentist Board officials this week following concerns that hospitals overcharge patients and disregard laws by detaining bodies over accrued hospital bills.  The body of Julius Nyerere was held at Reale hospital, Eldoret, for more than five months over a Sh4 million bill. But while hospitals are free to provide services and make money, they should seek alternative means of recovering money owed instead of holding bodies and patients. The law is clear. The net effect of detaining bodies only adds to the psychological and emotional trauma of their kin, which is unacceptable.    It is not enough to put the blame on the medical board for failing to regulate hospitals. MPs have the power to pass laws that will facilitate access to affordable healthcare for Kenyans and ease their suffering     MPs fault hospitals for detaining patients, bodies over unpaid bills  Proposed law seeks to save grieving kin over held bodies  Detaining patients illegal, court declares  Leading manufacturer clears Sh2.2m hospital bill for 50 patients  Mother who lost four children on crash held in hospital over bills, Press Review  Over 142 million shillings spent on hospital bills for Westgate attack victims  By Editorial | 10 hours ago By Editorial | 1 day ago By Editorial | 1 day ago By Editorial | 2 days ago
