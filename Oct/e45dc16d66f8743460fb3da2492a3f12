I now want to inform you that vaccines are available at the health centres and schools.”  Museveni said the Covid-19 vaccination campaign would prioritise frontline healthcare workers.  “Even if you don’t come out for vaccination, we will open the schools and the economy and if anything goes wrong, the moral responsibility is yours,” said the President.
