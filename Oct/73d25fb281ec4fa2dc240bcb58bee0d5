The government has refuted claim by the National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) Managing Director Joseph Kimote that the national grain reserves were empty.  Government Spokesperson Colonel (rtd) Cyrus Oguna yesterday said there was enough food and there was no course for alarm.  He said the State was committed to dealing with 2.1 million people in 23 counties who were experiencing food shortage.  “Right now I can assure you we have sufficient food to deal with the situation that we are facing,” Oguna said in Mogotio, Baringo County, when he launched the distribution of relief food.    Moi University lecturer innovates maize dryer  We have no maize in our silos, NCPB cries out  Fungal maize disease threatens maize yields in Uasin Gishu  Empty plates as maize prices rise 80pc in drought-hit regions Last week, NCPB told the National Assembly Agriculture Committee that the national reserves were depleted.
