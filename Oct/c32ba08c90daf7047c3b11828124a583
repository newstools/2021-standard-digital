Kenya's Joyciline Jepkosgei won a thrilling women's London Marathon on Sunday in two hours, 17 minutes and 43 seconds as world record holder and defending champion Brigid Kosgei faded late in the race to finish outside the podium places.  Sisay Lemma of Ethiopia was a comfortable winner of the elite men's race in a time of 2:04.01, crossing the line 27 seconds ahead of Kenya's Vincent Kipchuma with Ethiopian Mosinet Geremew third.  Jepkosgei, the reigning New York Marathon champion, smashed her personal best of 2:18.40 on her debut in the British capital, becoming the seventh fastest woman in history. The 28-year-old finished 15 seconds ahead of Ethiopian Degitu Azimeraw whose compatriot Ashete Bekere came third.  Kosgei, competing eight weeks after claiming silver at the Tokyo Games, was aiming for a third consecutive victory in London. The 27-year-old rallied briefly but finished fourth in 02:18.40.   Kenya's Kipchumba finishes second as Ethiopia's Sisay Lemma wins men's London Marathon  Stars set for epic clash at London Marathon today  Brigid Kosgei aiming to win her third London Marathon crown  Injury forces world record holder Keitany to retire  London Marathon scheduled for October again in 2022 The marathon, which celebrated its 40th anniversary in April, returned to its traditional route from Blackheath to The Mall for the first time in over two years.
