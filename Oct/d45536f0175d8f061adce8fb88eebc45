Police in Bomet are looking for a driver of a saloon car that was involved in an accident on Sotik-Narok road while ferrying six sacks of bang. Bomet Central Police Commander Musa Imamai said the driver escaped after the crash.   He said the suspect must have been badly injured and in hospital, but not in the Bomet ones, as police search there have borne no fruit.   “We suspect this was a convoy and when this vehicle was involved in the accident an accompanying one was used to whisk him away,” he said.     Five die in separate road accidents in Naivasha  21-year-old man kills two women in hit-and-run accident  Naivasha residents want footbridges along Nairobi-Nakuru highway to curb road accidents  Two motorcycle operators killed by speeding car  Nyatike Weed Menace: Fishermen suffering massive losses due to weed engulfing Lake Victoria beaches  4 people died in a road accident after personal car collided with a lorry along Machakos-Kitui road  Drugs worth millions of shillings nabbed by Anti-Narcotics unit in operation on Nairobi-Moyale Route By Julius Chepkwony | 40 minutes ago By Daniel Chege | 6 hours ago By Antony Gitonga | 9 hours ago By Gilbert Kimutai | 9 hours ago
