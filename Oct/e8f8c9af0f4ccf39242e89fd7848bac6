Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has defended a move by a section of leaders from the Western region to front Cotu Secretary-Seneral Francis Atwoli as the lead political negotiator.  Oparanya said the role doesn't make Atwoli the spokesman, and that his was to ensure the regions gets a fair share in the government that will be formed after next year's General Election.  “We have given Atwoli a chance to coordinate all of us so that we can come together and have a common stand on who we shall support for the presidency. We want our community's interests to be taken care of so that we are not left in the cold again after the elections.”  The Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya party leader Moses Wetang’ula did not attend the Sunday meeting where the resolution was reached.    Raila Odinga's pledge to tackle poverty to cost Sh137b  Raila Odinga confident of free and fair 2022 elections  Raila Odinga: I have forgiven Uhuru for calling me a mad man  Raila banks on consensus to avert fallout of allies in elections Speaking in Kakamega town yesterday, Oparanya said that they do not want to be in the opposition.
