The sentencing of a businessman accused of attempting to kill Ranalo Foods Restaurant owner William Osewe in 2016 at Garden Estate in Nairobi has been scheduled for today.  Tom Mboya, who is a tour operator, was found guilty of attempted murder and causing grievous bodily harm by outgoing Milimani Chief Magistrate Martha Mutuku last week after the court ruled that the prosecution's evidence was overwhelming.  "The offence of attempted murder is usually committed with an intention of killing the other person. I have also considered the evidence before court and it is not disputed that Mboya shot Osewe," Ms Mutuku ruled.  The court also considered the evidence of a security guard who heard Mboya shouting and saw him raise his gun and shoot several times at Osewe. "It is not in dispute that the accused shot at the complainant. He did so, not once but four times," said the magistrate.    Court stops bank from auctioning Osewe's hotel  Hotelier William Osewe stable after successful operation  Hotelier Osewe shot and seriously injured along Thika road  Court stops bank from auctioning Osewe's hotel  Hotelier William Osewe stable after successful operation  Hotelier Osewe shot and seriously injured along Thika road Mboya, in his mitigation through lawyer Benjamin Makokha, pleaded to be given a non-custodial sentence.
