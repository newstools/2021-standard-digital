This machine was necessary to the needs of my people,” Gichuki told The Standard by phone.  “Politicians think of the current generation while leaders think about the next generation. I think that asking for an X-Ray machine was better than asking for maybe a vehicle. This would save the next generation,” said Gichuki, adding that he is not planning to vie for a political post in the coming elections.  Gichuki is the son of a former Councilor now MCA) for Komothai ward.  “Maybe I will venture into politics later, but not in 2022,” Gakuya, who invited Raila for his birthday via a text message said.  “I have been a staunch supporter of Raila. I looked for his number, then invited him to my birthday via a text which he honoured.”  By Paul Ogemba | 4 hours ago By Collins Kweyu | 9 hours ago By Mate Tongola | 12 hours ago By Josphat Thiong’o | 23 hours ago
