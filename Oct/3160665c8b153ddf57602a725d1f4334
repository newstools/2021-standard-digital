One Kenya Alliance (OKA) leaders have converged in Kakamega County to kick off their joined campaigns for the presidency before they pick a flag bearer.  The leaders, Baringo Senator Gideon Moi (Kanu national chairman), Moses Wetang’ula (Ford Kenya), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) and Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper Party), converged at Kakamega Golf Club for a consultative meeting with delegates.  This comes amid suspicions triggered by revelations of behind the scenes negotiations between Wiper and ODM leaders that may push Mudavadi to consider other options.  The leaders are expected to address a series of roadside rallies in Kakamega town.  The coalition brings together seasoned politicians who, for a decade now, have been in opposition.  OKA principals unveil grand plan for State House contest  OKA rocked by suspicion over Mudavadi's planned coalition  One Kenya Alliance to start presidential campaign  OKA principals to begin two day tour of Western Formation of political alliances and new parties ahead of elections is not uncommon in Kenya.
