A two-year-old child was burnt to death and more than 50 families rendered homeless following two fire incidents in Naivasha, Nakuru county.  The minor had been locked in their house in Maraigushu trading centre.  Residents roughed up the boy's mother after she was found drinking alcohol in a nearby bar, accusing her of negligence.  “The mother claims to have left a candle burning and we suspect that was the main cause of the fire which killed the boy,” said Jane Wanjiru, a neighbour.    Five die in separate road accidents in Naivasha  I have climbed the mountain before, Raila to critics  Shock after Molo man's three children die in house fire  Are Kenyans ever prepared to fight fires?

Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru said investigations into the incidents are on.
