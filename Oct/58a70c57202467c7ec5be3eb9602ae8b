Governor Moses Lenolkulal and Samburu West MP Naisula Lesuuda called on the national government to ensure the security of locals and their property.  “We are asking the government to return guns back to police reservists so that they (reservists) can protect our people,” said Lenolkulal.  Lesuuda said: “Vices may never end if the government does not take stern action against those found culpable."  She said stern action should be taken against lax security officers.
