One Kenya Alliance chiefs Kalonzo Musyoka, Gideon Moi, Musalia Mudavadi, Moses Wetangula and Cyrus Jirongo [Fidelis Kabunyi, Standard]  One Kenya Alliance chiefs Gideon Moi, Musalia Mudavadi, Kalonzo Musyoka, Moses Wetangula and Cyrus Jirongo have taken their campaigns to Mt Kenya.  The OKA principals are attending a prayer service at Around the Globe Deliverance Ministry church in Thika after which they are expected to address area residents.  The OKA rally in President Uhuru Kenyatta's backyard of Kiambu comes barely hours after they met the president over the crafting of what has been dubbed a super alliance ahead of the 2022 General Elections.  They are hot on the heels of ODM leader Raila Odinga who toured the voter-rich region a fortnight ago.  Former bigwigs run to OKA, Ruto and Raila camps  Gideon: We'll offer free education, reduce taxes  OKA principals unveil grand plan for State House contest  OKA leaders kick off campaigns in Kakamega The OKA leaders toured Kakamega County  County to kick off their joined campaigns for the presidency before they pick a flag bearer.
