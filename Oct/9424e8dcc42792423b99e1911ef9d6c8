A woman accused of benefiting from child prostitution was arraigned at a Milimani court yesterday.   Leila Waithera Kassim appeared before Chief Magistrate Wendy Kagendo.  The prosecution alleged that on diverse dates between September and October within Nairobi CBD, Ngara and Eastleigh within Nairobi County, she knowingly procured a child named DN aged 16 years for the purpose of sexual intercourse.  The accused asked the court to defer the plea taking today as her lawyer was not in court. She said police had confiscated her phone and was not able to access her family.  "Your honour I plead with you to defer my plea taking to tomorrow because since I was arrested six days ago, I have not been able to talk to my lawyer," said Kassim.    Pandemic drives more women to prostitution in Kisii  Siaya twilight girls plead with county to step in after exit of local NGO  Pandemic drives more women to prostitution in Kisii  Siaya twilight girls plead with county to step in after exit of local NGO  Plight of Sex Workers: International Day marked in Nakuru County  Weekend Prime : Rising cases of school dropouts in the Coast due to drug abuse and prostitution  Art for Crime: Kariobangi group efforts against crime By Collins Kweyu | 19 minutes ago By Mireri Junior | 20 hours ago By Jael Mboga | 1 day ago By Josphat Thiong'o | 1 day ago
