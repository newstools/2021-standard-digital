The High Court has rejected an application by a family to withdraw a case against a police officer accused of killing their kin on July 30.  Constable Peter Kinoti reportedly shot and killed 29-year-old Morris Mutuma at Kimachia, Tigania West, in Meru County.  Kinoti took a plea on September 8 and denied killing Mutuma and was released on a bond of Sh300,000.  And now the late Mutuma's family, led by his mother Joyce Mburung’a, brothers Wilfred Mburung’a and Festus Murega, and cousins Joshua Mutwiri and Nicholas Gitonga, has filed an application to stop the case from proceeding to trial saying they have opted to solve the matter in a traditional way "to safeguard their cordial relationship with the local community."  However, the prosecution has opposed the application, saying the matter is a felony that can only be withdrawn by the Director of the Public Prosecutions.  High school teacher arrested over defilement   Haji alleges plot to kick him out of office as row with Kinoti escalates  Prisoners want to be fully involved in voting for President  Family's bid to drop murder charges against police officer flops The court noted that reconciliation does not apply for murder cases.
