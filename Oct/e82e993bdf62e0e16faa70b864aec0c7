It is alleged the suspect obtained Sh3.02m under false pretenses. [File, Standard]  A Nairobi-based businessman on Thursday, October 28, urged the prosecution to drop fraud charges against him so that he can refund Sh3 million that he owes his accuser.  Peter Fredrick Kimani Mbugua was arrested on allegations that – on diverse dates between August 6 and August 28 – he obtained Sh3.02 million from a Nairobi trader, Rose Muthoni Mwaura, under the pretense that he’d supply her with Soya beans.  The court heard that Mbugua knew he wasn’t in a position to deliver the said-goods.  Milimani Chief Magistrate Wendy Kagendo directed that Mbugua be detained at the Muthaiga Police Station until Tuesday, November 2, when he’ll be produced in court for a mention of the case and a report submitted on the money-refund progress.  Shop attendant charged with Sh9m fraud   When you feel like a fraud, but you’re not  Kitui trader, firm charged with Sh6.2m fraud  Ex-Kemri boss Davy Koech fined Sh19m for fraud  Echesa granted bail in Sh39b gun fraud case but to spend the weekend in custody  How Echesa roped DP William Ruto in Sh39b gun fraud case  Two police officers arraigned in court over charges of fraud and false pretense By Collins Kweyu | 12 hours ago By Mireri Junior | 20 hours ago By Jael Mboga | 1 day ago By Josphat Thiong'o | 1 day ago
