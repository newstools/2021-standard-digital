Government is yet to respond in a case filed by 7,000 displaced persons from Nyamira and Kisii counties.  At the Milimani law courts yesterday, Justice Hedwig Ong’udi directed the state to file a response before November 24. The case in which the IDPs are seeking compensation was being heard by Justice Weldon Korir before he was transferred. The IDPs sued the state in 2017.  The IDPs, led by Rev Nemwel Momanyi, claim Interior CS Fred Matiang’i and PS Karanja Kibicho have declined to compensate them.  The case will be heard on October 24, 2021.  The IDPs have also attempted to present their petition to the Senate and National Assembly in vain.   Kisii University vice chancellor suspends move to increase fees after protests  State directed to respond to compensation case for 7,000 IDPs  Kisii University sends home some students after fee increment demonstrations  Nyamira couple refuses to bury infant, demands DNA   On June 6, 2017, President Uhuru Kenyatta released Sh358 million for compensation of IDPs in Kisii County.
