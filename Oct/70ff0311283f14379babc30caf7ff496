At least 100,000 people in the county have been vaccinated against Covid-19.  Deputy Governor Peter Ndambiri and Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho made the announcement on Tuesday while inspecting the Wang’uru Stadium in preparation for the Mashujaa Day celebrations.  The PS said the stadium and a mini State Lodge were 95 per cent and 98 per cent complete. “All works are expected to be through by Friday (tomorrow) when the handover will be done,” said Kibicho. On billboards, Kibicho has said only two will be erected - one for the President and the other for the governor.  “There has been a misunderstanding and fight about billboards being erected in Ngurubani town. We have agreed with the security team that the only billboards to be visible will be that of the president and the governor. They will be up for seven days starting tomorrow (yesterday) 6pm.”    100,000 vaccinated as Kirinyaga county readies to host Mashujaa fete  Mt Kenya artistes and businesses look to reap big from Mashujaa Day event  Looming Mashujaa Day celebrations bring together political rivals in Kirinyaga  Why Kirinyaga County has captured public attention Mwea MP Josphat Kabinga thanked President Uhuru Kenyatta for chosing the sub-county to host the celebrations, saying it will boost the rice business.
