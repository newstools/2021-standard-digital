The MCA’s vehicle, a Toyota Land Cruiser Prado, collided head-on with an oncoming truck, killing the ward representative on the spot.

Nguu/Masumba is one of the 30 wards in Makueni County.  Timothy Maneno, the MCA-elect for Nguu/Masumba Ward, was on the verge of being locked out of the contest after the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) refused to clear him to vie over the aspirant’s alleged failure to produce clearance letters which would facilitate the gazettement of his ballot symbol.  Maneno consequently filed a petition in court on September 9.  On September 20, the court ordered the IEBC to clear the petitioner within 72 hours.
