The High Court in Eldoret has set free a 38-year-old man who had been convicted for defiling a 10-year-old girl.  Joshua Koech was charged in an Eldoret court with defiling the minor on December 2, 2013, in Keiyo South, Elgeyo Marakwet County.  On February 11, 2019, the then Eldoret Senior Principal Magistrate Harrison Barasa found him guilty and sentenced him to 25 years imprisonment.  But Koech filed an appeal on February 12, 2019, on grounds that his conviction was based on contradictory, scanty evidence which did not establish the statutory ingredients of defilement, or prove the charge beyond reasonable doubt.    Man escapes 50-year jail term over defilement after appeal  Olympic champion Kipchoge unveils his foundation  University of Eldoret expands its e-learning module for more reach  When defilement victims have to share the same home with their abusers He claimed that no investigations were conducted and the trial magistrate exhibited impartiality.
