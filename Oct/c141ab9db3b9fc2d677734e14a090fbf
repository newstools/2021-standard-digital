Lake Turkana hoteliers are counting losses following rising water levels that have submerged their premises.  More than 10 hotels have been closed down and property worth millions of shillings destroyed after the lake burst its banks.  Residents have also had to move out as the waters flood their homes.  Christine Arot, the proprietor of Christine Camp in Elliye Springs, said they had no option but to close down after her premises were flooded.  “Some buildings at the camp have been submerged. We cannot host visitors anymore. We had to shut down as we hope for better days ahead,” Arot told The Saturday Standard on Thursday.  Hotels in Coast register influx of local tourists  Creative thinking can boost hotel business during pandemic  Study: Lake Turkana may survive but the people close by will suffer  Tourism sector will suffer in Western if curfews persist, says industry body Denis Biwott, the manager of Eliye Springs Resort, said: “The rising water levels have swallowed the sandy beaches and left many businesses in a precarious situation.”  He said they had lost five cottages worth Sh5 million and two marine boats valued at Sh5 million.
