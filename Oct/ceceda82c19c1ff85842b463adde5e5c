Siaya Senator James Orengo has refuted claims that ODM has a list of preferred candidates for various seats in the next General Election.  Orengo dismissed the allegations, saying candidates can only be known after nominations. "Over the years even the most senior ODM party officials have had to go through the party nominations and I believe this will not change," he said.  "The story is false and malicious and meant to interfere with ongoing voter registration."  The Siaya Senator has interest in the governor's position and has endorsed East Africa Legislative Assembly MP Oburu Odinga to succeed him.    Consult party leadership first, Oparanya warns Wanjigi  Anybody ready to help Baba cane Wa-Jigy?   Raila banks on consensus to avert fallout of allies in elections  Sossion ditches Raila for DP Ruto  Pulpit Politics: ODM leader Raila Odinga welcomes move to ban politicians speaking in church  Raila comes up with a platform which he says will harmonize major issues affecting ordinary citizens  Wawaniaji wa nafasi ya Ugavana kaunti ya Mombasa kupitia chama cha ODM wajiandaa By Allan Mungai | 1 hour ago By Ndungu Gachane | 1 hour ago By Winfrey Owino | 4 hours ago By Winfrey Owino | 5 hours ago
