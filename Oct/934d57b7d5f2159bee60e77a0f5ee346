Thirteen Ethiopians arrested for being in the country illegally will be detained for another week.   The 13, two of them minors, appeared before Senior Principal Magistrate Henry Okwemba. "Let the accused persons be escorted to the Refugee Affairs Secretariat for assessment of their status before any step is taken," Mr Nyakwemba ruled.  They had pleaded not guilty to charges of being in the country illegally. "We have escaped our country that is at war," they told court.  The court had ruled that the 11 adults would plead afresh after Kirimi Guantai, their advocate, submitted that the accused did not communicate well with the Amharic interpreter.  The 13 were arrested on September 19 on Embu-Meru highway.  I don't mind competition, Ngirici reacts to Waiguru's defection  DP Ruto: Waiguru is bold for joining UDA  Governor Waiguru joins UDA   How KiKamba's Kinyaa became Kirinyaga, Kenya     MBIU YA KTN[1]: Usajili kura Makueni, Siasa Chamani jubilee na Kilio Cha Wakulima  Zaidi ya wafanyabiashara 300 kunufaika Kirinyaga, Mrundiko wa Kesi | MBIU YA KTN (Sehemu ya Pili)  Coffee farmers from Kirinyaga county set to benefit from value-addition machines By Phares Mutembei | 2 days ago By Boniface Gikandi | 2 days ago By Muriithi Mugo | 2 days ago By Fidelis Kabunyi | 2 days ago
