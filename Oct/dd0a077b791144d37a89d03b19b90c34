A businessman and his company were on Tuesday charged before a Milimani court with obtaining goods worth more than Sh7 million through false pretences.  Ndisya Muluu Mutua, his firm Ndisya Trading Ltd, and his wife Fridah Kambua Ndisya, who was not in court, were charged with eight counts of fraudulently obtaining goods from Pembe Flour Mills Limited in Lunga-Lunga, Nairobi.  Ndisya appeared before Senior Principal Magistrate Bernard Ochoi. They were charged that on diverse dates between December 02, 2019 and April 01, 2021 at the mills in Nairobi, they conspired to obtain goods worth Sh6,274,240 from Pembe Flour Mills limited by false pretences.  They were also charged with presenting cheques worth over Sh1 million to the mills on diverse dates between 2020 and 2021, from a Ndisya bank account with knowledge that it had insufficient funds.  Ndisya was arrested last Friday in Kitui and taken to Nairobi. He was released on a Sh3 million bond or alternatively pay Sh1 million cash bail. His wife was ordered to appear in court on October 26 during the mention of the case, so she can take a plea.  Over 85,000 poor families in Kitui benefit in NHIF insurance deal  Ex-Kemri boss Davy Koech fined Sh19m for fraud  NHIF loses Sh10 billion through fake claims from health facilities  SIM swap fraud suspects to be arraigned in Kiambu     Governor Charity Ngilu urges Kalonzo and Raila to mend fences and work together ahead of 2022 polls  Kitui County government bans limestone mining activity as locals decry environmental harm  Usambazaji wa Chanjo: Viongozi wa dini kaunti ya Kitui wazua maswali kuhusu chanjo ya AstraZeneca By Stephen Nzioka | 1 day ago By Muriithi Mugo | 5 days ago By Wilberforce Okwiri | 9 days ago By Stephen Nzioka | 12 days ago
