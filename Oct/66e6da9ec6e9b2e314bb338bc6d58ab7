When Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho announced that he was ready to work with Kirinyaga businessman Anthony Ngirici, many were in disbelief.  Ngirici who is the husband of woman rep Purity Ngirici has in the past had many run-ins with the Interior PS.  Some leaders even speculated that Kibicho was to be Wangui's running mate for governor's position, a claim that Kibicho has since refuted, saying he was a government employee not ready to join politics for now.  "I called the wife one day to speak about Mashujaa fete and the husband called back asking why I wanted to arrest him. We agreed to meet and that was the beginning of Kirinyaga Kwanza," Kibicho divulged.    Why Kirinyaga County has captured public attention  Nairobi ‘boda boda’ chaos leaves rider killed, officer injured  State suspends parallel county Mashujaa Day celebrations  Wangui Ngirici, Martha Karua, Anne Waiguru to face off in Kirinyaga The PS eventually met with the businessman at a meeting in Kagio market last month and a handshake between the two was witnessed by hundreds of people in attendance.
