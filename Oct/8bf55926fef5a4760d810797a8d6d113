[Kennedy Gachuhi, Standard]  Detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI) have killed three people suspected to be part of a car theft syndicate operating in Ruiru, Kiambu County.  The DCI reported that they cornered the gang between Githurai and Mwiki areas in Kiambu County on Friday morning.  “Officers had kept a night-long vigil patrolling their areas of jurisdiction. 30 minutes into the devil's hour, the sleuths observed some suspicious activity by four men onboard a KBZ 113S Toyota Probox, just as it joined the murram road connecting Mwiki-Kasarani and Githurai 45 roads,” DCI said.  Police signaled the vehicle to pull over but the driver sped-off, prompting a police chase.  Man charged with stealing girlfriend’s Prado  Police arrest two and recover motor vehicle accessories in house  Five suspected robbers shot dead on Kakamega-Kisumu road  Police bust gang that robs without firing a single shot Authorities say the gang, who were all armed then opened fire at the police.
