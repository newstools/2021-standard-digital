A businessman found dead at the Lake Nakuru National Park will be buried on Thursday.  Daniel Mahinda, popularly known as Mwas, was the son of Joseph Mahinda, who owns several buildings in Nakuru town.  Nakuru Town East Criminal Investigations Officer Benson Mutie said an autopsy conducted on Monday gave inconclusive results. “We have collected samples for toxicology tests,” he said.  He was found dead on Saturday after checking into the park the previous day. He had driven himself into the park in his SUV, which alerted the game wardens when they found it stalled.  The deceased was the general manager of Farmers World Ltd, a family business dealing in farm inputs with branches in Nakuru, Nairobi and Kiambu.  Probe begins on death of businessman in Lake Nakuru National Park  KWS ranger airlifted to hospital after being gored by rhino [PHOTOS]   The return of Flamingos to Lake Nakuru  Rhino project fights to stay afloat decade later  Revenues have dropped significantly at the Lake Nakuru National Park  CS Najib Balala loses another Rhino to poachers even as he tell Kenyans to go to hell  BREAKING NEWS: Two bodies of victims of Lake Nakuru helicopter crash recovered  By Michael Saitoti | 2 hours ago By Daniel Chege | 2 hours ago By Daniel Chege | 2 hours ago By Irissheel Shanzu | 16 hours ago
