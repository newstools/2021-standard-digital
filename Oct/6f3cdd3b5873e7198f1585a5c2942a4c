Addressing a rally at the town in Makueni County on Monday, DP Ruto told the call girls to organise themselves in a SACCO so that he can wire the money to them.  The DP Ruto’s promise came after the commercial sex workers appealed to him to expedite the release of the 'Hustlers Empowerment Fund' so that they can venture into respectful businesses.  Ruto vowed to ensure the sex workers had started a respectable business once they receive the money.  DP says youths need practical solutions to problems not stipend  Makueni man goes into hiding after raping his mum  Tsavo West: Rich in animals and history  Commercial sex workers plead with county to step into void left by exit of local NGO Ruto drummed up support for his Bottom-Up economic model saying it will promote inclusive and sustainable growth among Kenyans.  “The bottom-up economic model is keen on promoting inclusive and sustainable growth through a robust framework that will foster enterprises in our country,” he said.
