The officers were heading to the ranch from Tingamara area on Tuesday when they were ambushed.  This brought to four the number of reservists shot by suspected bandits in the last one week.  According to Nyahururu deputy county commissioner Hezron Nyamberi, the suspects were arrested at their Mogwarak area hideout.  Three more police reservists shot in Laikipia  Military steps in to bring peace in volatile Laikipia and Baringo  Mystery of Laikipia University student killed in her hostel  Laikipia University student killed by roommate’s boyfriend   “We got information from members of the public that some non-residents were hiding somewhere in the forest. They were among those who had attacked the reservists. We moved into action,” he said.  Mr Nyamberi said some escaped even as police arrested the two.  “They are providing us with information. We will soon arrest those who escaped,” he said, adding that they were being held at Rumuruti police station.  Nyamberi said they did not recover any weapons from the suspects.  In the last two months, nine people, among them two police officers, have been killed and hundreds of livestock stolen by bandits. This has seen hundreds of people flee the area.  The victims are now in a stable condition, according to the medics at the hospital.
