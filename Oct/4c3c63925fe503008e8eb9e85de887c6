Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho has told off the Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru over the Mashujaa celebrations invitation list.  Speaking in Ndindiruku, the PS said the national celebrations committee gave the governor's office 300 invitation cards double the 150 she was quoted as owning up in a section of the media.  Kibicho said that the other leaders including the woman representative got five cards each.  The PS said the Kirinyaga governor has been fully involved in the preparations for the fete from day one and is in a WhatsApp platform where communication was being done.  Kibicho revealed that there was a deadline to hand over names to the Government printing press for inclusion in the final list and those who had failed to meet it should not blame the organising committee.  Will Waiguru listen to her heart or many voices of supporters?  Big men from Kirinyaga pounce in silence, and get things done  100,000 vaccinated as Kirinyaga readies to host Mashujaa fete  100,000 vaccinated as Kirinyaga county readies to host Mashujaa fete "We said in every location we needed five names agreed between MCAs, chiefs and their assistants," Kibicho added.
