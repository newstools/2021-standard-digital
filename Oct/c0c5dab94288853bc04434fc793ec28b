A woman who was part of a drinks spiking gang had a taste of her own medicine when she unknowingly took a drink that she had laced and passed out.  The DCI has said Leah Mwenja, 31, was found unconscious together with three men at Shikara apartments in Nyali, Mombasa county, where the men had booked themselves.  Earlier, the three believed to be senior Kisumu county officials and an MCA were at the popular Masai beach restaurant when some women approached them.  The county officials bought rounds of alcohol and stayed until late.  Detectives arrest man masquerading as magistrate  Memory card dispute leaves two dead  Haji says no proof judge plotted to kill Cohen  Road projects to be completed on time, says CS James Macharia When it approached 3am, the women told the county officials that it was time they moved to the rooms and they left with more drinks.  The following morning other county employees who were part of the team went looking for their seniors, only to find them unconscious in their rooms.  Also found reeling from the effects of her own dose was Mwenja, who had unknowingly taken a drink she had spiked.  Her two other accomplices fled when they realised their partner in crime had passed out.  They left with the county officials’ laptops, mobile phones and other valuables. Detectives in Nyali police station are interrogating Mwenja on the whereabouts of her accomplices to recover the valuables stolen from the county officials.  Doctors at the Coast General Hospital who treated the three have declared them to be out of danger.
