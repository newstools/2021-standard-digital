Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i beefs up security in Laikipia County. [File, Standard]  Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i has ordered non-residents of Laikipia County to leave effective immediately as he beefs up security in the area which is prone to banditry attacks.  This comes in the wake of increased cases of hardcore bandits taking advantage of the prevailing drought menace in the counties neighbouring Laikipia to commit criminal activities.  In a statement to newsrooms on Tuesday, October 12, the CS said that as a result of the ongoing banditry activities, innocent lives had been lost, scores injured and property of unestimated value destroyed in the pre-meditated attacks.  “Despite the enhanced presence of security teams, criminals are still trying to challenge the Government's resolve to restore normalcy and the economic livelihoods of the residents of Laikipia,” Matiang’i’s statement read in part.  Special command team to take over Laikipia security operation  Painful tales of police reservists living at the mercy of bandits  Police arrest nanny suspected of murdering employer’s son  Laikipia: Kenya’s high county In his statement, the CS also directed the beefing up of the ongoing security operations and deployment of additional special forces to the affected area.
