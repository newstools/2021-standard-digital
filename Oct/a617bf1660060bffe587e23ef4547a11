Tom Mboya (L) will serve 23 years in jail for shooting William Osewe (R) in December 2016. [File, Standard]  Nairobi businessman Tom Mboya, who shot Ronalo Foods Restaurant owner William Osewe in December 2016, has been sentenced to 23 years in jail without the option of fine.  Milimani Chief Magistrate Martha Mutuku ruled that evidence produced by the Prosecution against Mboya was “overwhelming”.  The convict, who owns a tour company, had been charged with attempted murder.  The court heard that on December 1, 2016, while at Roasters Inn on Thika Road, Mboya drew out his gun and shot Osewe in the chest and stomach, causing him serious injuries.  Milimani court to sentence tour operator who was found guilty of shooting Ranalo Foods owner  Attempting suicide shouldn’t be treated as crime, it’s a health issue  Two year old child dies after falling from storey building  Tom Mboya was against external borrowing for development It was alleged that the two had fought over a woman.
