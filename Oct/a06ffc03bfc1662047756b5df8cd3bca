Over 100 Kenyans have been hired by an Italian cruise ship firm in the post-Covid-19 era.  17 chefs jetted out of the country to work aboard Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) cruise ship in Europe, giving a ray of hope to thousands of seafarers in the country.  Principal Secretary in the State Department for Shipping and Maritime Affairs, Dr Nancy Karigithu, said the chefs flew out to Italy to join cruise ships owned by MSC.  "This is an ongoing programme where deserving and qualified Kenyan youth are recruited to join MSC vessels operating worldwide," said Karigithu.  She said the airlifts send renewed hope to the young people that the sector was recovering from the 15-month turmoil caused by Covid-19.   Things looking up as 2.1 million Kenyans back to work after Covid mass layoffs  Skills to steer your firm into the future  Youth urged to exploit digital skills for employment  Create jobs to help the youth overcome challenges that lead to insecurity  Ministry of Health receives 180,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine as a donation from Gov't of Greece  HEALTH WATCH: How Covid-19 misinformation worldwide has created panic by misleading masses  KEMRI makes a breakthrough in the fight against Covid-19 by developing a Virus Transport Media (VTM) By World Economic Forum | 6 days ago By Graham Kajilwa | 7 days ago By World Economic Forum | 13 days ago By World Economic Forum | 20 days ago
