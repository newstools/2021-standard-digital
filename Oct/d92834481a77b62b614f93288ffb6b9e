[James Omoro, Standard]  The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party has opened an office in Ndhiwa Constituency to aid in voter registration.  The office, situated in Ndhiwa town, was initially opened in 2017 but was shut down due to wrangles within the party.  Ndhiwa ODM chairman, Ogina Nyabola, and Life for Children Welfare Organisation Chief Executive, Michael Agwanda, reopened it on Thursday.   "We want to enhance voter registration campaigns in this constituency and the campaigns are going to be coordinated from this office," Agwanda said.  Western leaders issue demands, want Oparanya to deputise Raila  School where teachers wish they could have lessons in latrines  Is DP Ruto an unassailable frontrunner or mere pacesetter?  We have confidence in IEBC, say ODM leaders Agwanda, who is eyeing Ndhiwa parliamentary seat, said increased voter registration would improve the chances of ODM leader Raila Odinga’s chances of winning the presidential seat.  Karachuonyo Constituency ODM Chairman, George Maigo, urged residents who had registered as voters to verify their details.   In Kisii County, Dagoretti North MP Simba Arati opened voter sensitisation offices across the nine sub-counties.
